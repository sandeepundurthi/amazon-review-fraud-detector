"The Type Cover provides a nice typing experience for the SP4. It is able to mimic the same experience provided by a notebook but it isn't quite there. Well, it's better than the keyboards built into cheap notebooks but not quite but there with the higher end notebooks. I do like that you can type at an angle or flat, I prefer typing at an angle. The keys feel nice and provide a firm, tactile feedback when clicking them in. They are also backlight and that turns on automatically when in a dim room. The Type Cover is a little flexible and you will notice some bounce when typing but it isn't bad, definitely better than a keyboard in a $400 Dell notebook.The trackpad could use some work. Microsoft made it bigger in the 4th iteration of the Type Cover along with covering it in glass but it still feels somewhat cramped. The trackpad is also noisy, really noisy. I don't use it when I'm in a meeting and instead touch the screen or use the Pen. But the Type Cover is protective, it can turn around completely, and it can be easily attached or removed via the magnetic connector on the bottom of the Surface. It works and is definitely the best solution on the market for the Surface Pro, just don't expect it to perform the same as the keyboard in the Dell XPS13 or HP Spectre x360.The fingerprint scanner is accurate and works like a charm. I just have to wrest my finger on the sensor and that's it. No swiping or any of that nonsense, it just works. I haven't had any problems with it rejecting my finger because it couldn't read it.Most people will be fine with the regular Type Cover and don't need the fingerprint scanner. Windows Hello, which uses your face to log in, works on every Surface Pro 4. Most people aren't going to benefit by also scanning their fingerprint as Windows Hello is accurate, fast, and secure. I have used my fingerprint scanner three times in the two months I've owned my Surface Pro 4 and that was only because I wasn't looking at my Surface when logging in.Save yourself the money and get the regular Type Cover. However, people with a Surface Pro 3 should definitely upgrade to this. Logging in with your fingerprint is faster, easier, and more secure than typing in your Windows PIN number every time and the new keyboard layout and trackpad are a definitely improvement over the Type Cover 3. Upgrading to this Type Cover will extend the life of your Surface Pro 3 making it easier to wait for the Surface Pro 5, maybe even the Pro 6.",5.0,454,0.2183489304812835,0,11,3,0.3908255347593582,-0.04546028970611293,-1

"I have a Surface Pro 3 and have loved using it, but the type cover always felt a little less than functional to me. It worked, but I always preferred typing on a full laptop or computer printer if it were anything more than a quick paragraph. Don't even get me started on the tracpad! It was too small and nowhere near sensitive enough. No more! This keyboard feels as good as one on a quality laptop would and it's a joy to type on it. The tracpad isn't even in the same class as the old one. It feels great, it responsive, and is large enough to use comfortably and without moving my hands from the keyboard. I don't see much need to upgrade from the Surface Pro 3 to the 4, but I definitely recommend upgrading the keyboard and pen! The fingerprint scanner is a nice touch and it works great. I've never had to rescan my finger to log in (coming from someone who cannot get phone fingerprint scanners to work ever). However, it's not really necessary. I was hoping that I could use it with a password manager so I could log in to websites with a fingerprint, but I haven't been able to figure that out yet. Whether to get the cover with the scanner or not is a personal choice. Regardless, I recommend either of the updated type covers!",5.0,235,0.24397893772893775,4,9,1,0.37801053113553107,-0.013799071949526787,-1
"I bought this keyboard solely because I liked how it felt in the store when I typed compared to the type cover I purchased with my Surface Pro 3 over a year ago. I'd spent time typing on this one in the store and thought I knew what to expect. Boy was I wrong! First, yes - the keyboard is exponentially more comfortable and feels somehow faster than the older type cover. Second, WOW the trackpad. This is, by far, the smoothest and most perfectly tuned trackpad I have ever used. The default sensitivity for both movement and tap-to-click is perfect. Third, the fingerprint ID is more useful than I'd expected. In addition to the Windows 10 functionality I already knew about, it also works as a login feature for my password manager and, I'm sure, much more that I haven't discovered yet. Finally, let's talk about (cringe) lapability. The keyboard's magnetic attachment to the screen feels stronger and the whole keyboard feels more rigid and solid than my older type cover. The end result is a device configuration that very closely mimics the stable feeling of a decent laptop. Overall, this keyboard made my Surface Pro 3 new again. In short, this upgrade for my Surface Pro 3 works perfectly and offers improvements I wasn't expecting. I'll be honest and say that I almost never use my old touch cover anymore - I just didn't like it. This, however, I will use. It's one of those things I didn't realize I needed until I got it. If you're a Surface Pro 3 owner and you're looking for a way to refresh that system and make it feel new again - this works well.",5.0,284,0.24350649350649353,1,18,1,0.3782467532467533,-0.02077486378776139,-1
"I've had this keyboard case for a day. I figured I'd review it now, as many reviews aren't up yet.Compared to the type cover that I bought with my Surface Pro 3, this one is a huge improvement. The keys feel so much more bouncy and the trackpad is a dream. I love the spacing of the keys on this keyboard, and it makes typing on it so much easier. I now have no desire to connect an external keyboard to my SP3.As an engineering student who uses MS Excel a lot, the function keys (F1, F2, etc.) are very important to me. In this keyboard, you can chose to toggle either the function keys or the extra keys, like the mute key and PrtScn button. It works like the caps lock key does, and it stays on even after shutting the computer off. This, believe it or not, is the number one reason why I bought this keyboard.The backlighting of the keyboard still has (about) the same number of dimness settings however, the transition between each is much more smooth and adds a very nice touch to the keyboard. I'm not going to say that the keys are evenly lit- the spacebar is not lit as much as the others- but it still feels very refined and works well. The backlighting is on the edge of the keys, as well as the individual letters. The trackpad and fingerprint reader does not have backlighting.The keyboard also feels a lot less flimsy than the last iteration, which is a plus. In fact, it's not really flimsy at all.SEE EDIT! The fingerprint reader works almost every time, but I'm still getting used to it. I plan to update this review soon, when I decide if it was worth the extra money- I'm on the fence about that.

"I should have known by the price this was too good to be true. Although the sound is pretty good for the price there is a MAJOR flaw that I simply cannot live with.

"Beware that this mount will NOT fit the Sony XBR75x850c without some customization that you will have to learn on the fly. It is not in the instructions or on the Sanus website. I probably wouldn't have bought this mount for this TV if I knew of the problem ahead of time. I only came to the realizations discussed below after spending several hours trouble shooting the situation, by which time I had nicked the mount up a bit and felt I couldn't return it.The problem is that the two bracket bars that you mount on the TV sit flush so you assume you do not need to use any of the provided spacers. However, once you mount the TV onto the wall unit and try and put the click cap on the lower cross bar (part number 22), you'll see that this lower cross bar goes so far that it hits raised edges on either side of the back panel of the TV. This is slight, but prevents the lower bar from fully seating into the receivers of the vertical brackets. This prevents the click cap from fitting properly and you won't be able to screw it together. The click cap is a critical component because it holds the bottom of the TV into place on the mount, which is very important when you are tilting the TV.There are two possible solutions. One is to install a spacer between the bracket bar and TV when you start off. Two problems here, one is that it will now be 1/2 less flush, and the other is that there does not seem to be a medium length screw provided that will fit the small spacer yet not penetrate too far into the TV. There is a short screw, fine for when not using any spacer, and a long screw that looks too long to use with the small spacer with this Sony TV (which appears to have a shallow screw receiver. Sorry that I can't tell you if it is since I went directly to solution number two: cut a few inches off the end of each side of the lower horizontal bar to prevent it from running over into the raised area of the back of the TV. This appears fine to me because this lower bar just appears to provide stability. The top bar and wall unit hold the weight. Basically you are cutting the lower horizontal bar short of where the back of the TV sticks out again. Not elegant, I suppose, but it works and keeps it more flush to the wall. You'll see what I mean if you have to go through this exercise.I'm fine with other aspects of the mount. We mounted dead center on the wall so didn't have to worry about the tilt issues that other people mention, but I could see where that could be a problem since the mount has some play. You'd probably have to pay a lot more for a stiffer mount (!).The people at Sanus were very helpful dealing with other questions I had. And I have been happy with two other mounts I bought form them for other TVs. I tried to explain all the above to them but was unsuccessful because its hard to do unless you are looking at it together.",3.0,556,0.036522435897435916,1,25,1,0.08173878205128204,-0.11851810648488581,-1
"Purchased this product to mount my new Panasonic 65 plasma TV - model TCP65GT50. Wanted a fully articulating mount so I could move it easily to adjust viewing angle as well as access connections on back of the TV, and also wanted a slim profile so it would sit as close to the wall as possible when fully retracted. This mount does all of these things well. I was originally looking at the VLF311 which appeared very similar to the VLF410 except the VLF311 only accomodates TVs up to 65 and costs less, so I emailed Sanus asking about the difference and one of the reps immediately replied and asked that I call him so he could explain. He told me that the VLF410 is the 'second generation' of the VLF311 and offers improved balancing of large TVs. This made sense because I did recall seeing a few customer reviews of the VLF311 saying that their TVs wouldn't hang perfectly level. Of course, this begs the question of why they are still selling the VLF311 when they have admitted it needed to be updated. Anyway, I needed to mount my TV centered between two windows, but the two 16 studs I had to use were exactly four inches off center of where the mount neeeded to be hung. Since the VLF411 has multiple pre-drilled slots which are designed to accomodate studs between 14 and 22 apart, I was able to use two unmatching slots to compensate for three of those four inches but this still left me with the mount being one inch off-center between my two windows. To get that last inch, I hung the TV on the mount and then simply slid the TV one inch to the left so it was hanging one inch off-center of the mount, but perfectly centered between my two windows. Problem solved No, the 86 lb. TV would ever-so-slightly tilt to the left since it was hanging off-center. So much for 2nd generation improvement of the mount! It still has very little tolerance for TVs not hanging perfectly centered. Undeterred, and deciding that the TV was hanging about 6 lower than where I really wanted it, I started over and installed the mount 6 higher and INTENTIONALLY a bit off-level to the right, so when I reinstalled the TV one inch to the left of center on the mount, it hung perfectly. Bottom line -- the multiple pre-drilled mounting slots give you some flexibility to accomodate 'off-center' studs, but if you need more than 3 or 4 inches of wiggle room then be prepared to take more creative action.",5.0,437,0.20903460278460279,1,30,1,0.3954826986076986,-0.10900018245881005,-1
"Ok this is for those on the fence about buying a cheaper mount or a Sanus. I have bought about 5 mounts from Amazon and they all have been the 39 or 49 mounts. They have all worked fine but i have a heavy 55 plasma and wanted an articulating mount. I would not tract any of this amounts to do anything but just hang the TV.I bit the bullet and ordered the Sanus. 1st impression is WOW!!! This bracket weighs 25lbs. Yes, 25LBS. Almost as much as some TV'S. The cheaper mounts barely register on the scale. You immediately notice the heft and quality of this piece. It moves fluidly and it is all finished nicely. Everything is well though out and all edges are finished. Bolts all have covers and it has ZERO cheap feel to it.I was in the camp of why pay more but with TV's climbing in prices again there is no way after side by side comparison you would buy the cheaper one. Order both and when you pick up the Sanus box without even opening it you will be blown away. I will update when used for a while but unless things go bad fast I can't see tho snot being a huge jump in quality. I live in CA and always feared a tv coming off the wall but I feel 100 confident this will be up there no matter what.",5.0,239,0.2068686868686869,3,12,1,0.39656565656565657,-0.01858004251312273,-1
"This so called slim mount does not allow shifting left/right unless fully extended....defeating the purpose of a slim mount in most installations. If you slide the TV on the mounting bar, the bar will tilt or bend and the TV will be tilted toward the heavier side of the bar. This contradicts the information advertised on their webpage, although they have clarified the description somewhat here on amazon. The only way to shift it is to fully extend it from the wall, then the wall arms themselves can shift a few inches on the wall plate. If you are able to install the mount centered between two studs, then perhaps you have no need to shift the TV while in the slim position. My studs were only 3 off center of my wall, yet my TV is lopsided when I move it a few inches to the center. From everything Sanus described about this mount at the time, I understood the TV could be shifted while in any position. Not even close! I need the TV to be close to the wall due to some near side seating. Because of this mount's limitations, we can't view the TV from those sides (the Mount os too far from the wall) and have the TV centered at the same time. I could have purchased a much less expensive slim mount that would have had less limitations than this one. This mount did not fit the bill.",1.0,244,-0.034895833333333334,1,12,1,0.2825520833333333,-0.00152918422515258,-1
"I installed this for use with a Sony KDL40HX800, a model about 3 years old and weighing less than 40 pounds. This mount is what is found when using the Sanus website Mountfinder for this model. Most of the one star detraction is my fault, but I'll let Sanus share the star because this mount doesn't really have the rotation that I needed. I didn't specifically look at the rotation spec, my fault, but it's only 30 degrees. Even using a TV that's at the very low end of the size spec, this is a pretty low value, and it would be nice to find different models of mounts that feature different specs for different needs. This one is touted to be super slim, and indeed it is, which I needed due to placement in a walkway to a door. Going for this feature sacrificed rotation evidently. The feature of moving laterally is nice, but of dubious value except in very specific circumstances.The other specs of 10 degree tilt, seems to be about actual performance, but the extension from wall value is spec'ed at 10, but was actually 14. The tilt mechanism was the only poor performer. Even with the tension completely released, the sider binds at about 75 tilt. Adding a light coat of lithium grease didn't help. It will achieve full tilt with a firmer jiggle, but it really should be smooth as silk.One outstanding feature is a heavy paper (vinyl coated) template for marking the wall. Many time companies provide newspaper weight templates, which are not stiff enough to get a reliable mark. This template is also dead on for hole location.All the other aspects of the mount are excellent. I have no doubt it would hold full value of weight specified, and is constructed with no corners cut on quality. The instructions are good, and the installation process is well documented with illustrations and correct. The only thing that could be better for installation is the screw selection provided. Two different lengths of M4, M6 and M8 screws are provided for attaching the rails to the TV, depending on how the back of your TV is constructed. For my TV, the M6 14mm was way to short with a short spacer, and not quite long enough with the 40mm and a long spacer. For my TV, something in between 14 and 40 would allow more threads engaged in the TV.So bottom line is that it's almost perfect for what the specs are, but it would be nice if Sanus would provide all mounts that would fit rather than just one.Kudos to Amazon as well. The price dropped from 249 to 199 two days after my order. One call of 2 minutes resulted in the credit of 50.",4.0,461,0.1666433239962652,0,15,1,0.21667833800186742,-0.03199626021367363,-1
"Six months ago my FH and I bought a Panasonic Viera 58"" LCD TV. We also bought this wall mount to hold it up. We happily took it home, set it up, and for six months, enjoyed the TV without a care in the world -- Until this morning. We were in the kitchen making breakfast when we heard a crash from the living room, and ran in to find the wall mount had FALLEN OUT OF THE WALL. I double checked that we had had it in studs with our stud finder (just like I did when I installed it), and found that the back panel had bent up. When I lifted the tv to move it, i saw that it was COVERED in spiderweb cracks. I am so, so, upset right now. This piece of trash has cost me ~1200$ or more to get a new tv.",1.0,149,0.3174397031539889,0,16,13,0.4587198515769944,-0.039412900032722464,-1
"Ive heard quite a few Bluetooth speakers. Some better than others, but one thing they all lacked was good Bass output. Well that has been more than solved here. But its not just about Bass here. The overall sound quality is outstanding. And while were talking about how great it is how about full Alexa control built in as well? YUP... that too. Connectivity to Pandora, iHeart, Spotify, another others as well ensure you will get plenty of choices when it comes to music. In the box is the of course the BT speaker, power adapter, USB cable, quick start guide, and in my case I got the charging dock as well for free. Im not sure but this might be a Best Buy thing. The speaker itself is a nice graphite color that should match most home entertainment set ups. There is also a Blue one if you want something a little more blingier (probably not a word, but you get what I mean). It weighs almost 3 pounds which I assume is because the speaker has some decent drivers to get that the incredible Bass it puts out. Set up is fairly easy. Just download the Ultimate ears app from your devices app store, log into your Amazon account, turn speaker on and follow the instructions to get the speaker and Alexa features all set up. You can also use manual set up via long pressing the power button for pairing to your chosen device. As stated before one of the coolest features this has over some other BT speakers is voice control. So in addition to a Bass rocking speaker you can use it for all sorts off voice commands. Weather updates, play/ pause music, etc. And to top all of this off it is IP67 Waterproof for up to 30 minutes in 3' of water. Accidentally drop it in your tub while having a relaxing bath, kicked into your pool while playing poolside. No problem. The initial charge can take up to 3 hours and is rated for up to 16 hours. So a full day should be no problem at all. And if you have the dock as well just keep it on the dock and never have to worry about charging it. All day music with Alexa their anytime you need it. This is by far the best sounding, and most feature rich Bluetooth speaker I have ever heard. And will be recommending it to anyone looking for a nice gift this Holiday season. The name “Ultimate” is definitely deserved here!! It is the Ultimate Bluetooth Wi-Fi speaker for sure.",5.0,436,0.2630081300813008,2,9,1,0.3684959349593496,-0.05178203539982962,-1
"I have been completely blown away by the performance of this new Megablast portable speaker by Ultimate Ears. I currently own a Boom speaker, which is a previous generation of portable speaker from Ultimate Ears, and this Megablast speaker is a vast improvement in every way. The Megablast looks fairly similar in style to the Boom, with the same cylindrical shape and rubbery feel to the buttons. It is much larger than the Boom. It is advertised as waterproof and this held true when it was tested in a bathtub. This makes it great for outdoor situations, especially for the pool, boat, or camping. The Megablast has far-field voice recognition, reacting to my voice commands from very far away, inside and outside. It can connect either via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. It is compatible with Alexa Voice which allows it respond to all of the typical Alexa questions and commands. The speaker currently works with Amazon Music, iHeartRadio, TuneIn (through the Alexa App). Via Bluetooth, you can connect to your phone and play music from the various music services that are out there. There is a free Ultimate Ears app that will need to be downloaded to your phone which walks the user through connecting the speaker and logging in to Amazon and other music services. The speaker does come with a D-ring, Micro USB cord, and power adapter. I also obtained the Ultimate Ears Power Up charging dock which works nicely with the speaker. The Power Up charging dock works with both Megablast and Blast speakers, but not the previous generation of speakers like the Boom. For me, a single charge lasted about fifteen hours. Now about the sound: it is amazing and comes out in all directions. Compared to my old Boom, music sounds more full and rich, even at loud volume levels. The improvement in the bass is the most noticeable. Music has real weight to it that you just don't hear with other portable speakers thanks to the improved bass drivers. The highs, the mid-range, and the lows just sound so good. I have really enjoyed using the Megablast. It is easy to use, has quality sound, and allows me to use Alexa. If you are looking for a quality portable speaker, I highly recommend the Ultimate Ears Megablast.",5.0,382,0.17585040885040887,0,6,1,0.41207479557479554,-0.02148679017910693,-1
"I have tried out a bunch of bluetooth speakers over time. As just a speaker this one is pretty good quality. As far as taking the place of my Alexa it is not up to mustard.Get it for a quality portable speaker, and use the Amazon features just as a bonus.The speaker was easy to get started out of the box. Mine also came with a wireless charging pad (great feature to add to the purchase). It connected easy with my phone to play music etc. I had issues getting Alexa up and running at first but that may have been a wifi connection issue. You will be required to use the app for the speaker to connect. The connection is good, and sound quality is good. One thing I noticed with this brand of speaker before (and this one) the volume up/down controls are slow to respond and lead to over-adjusting the volume before it catches up. This is because it's controlling the phone/device volume it's connected to wirelessly and I guess there's a lag. There are only 4 buttons, volume up, down, power, and sync. All self explanatory. The speaker is a little heavy, so while portable, you probably don't want to carry it around. I suggest taking it where you want and sitting in on a table.The charging pad is great. You simply need to replace the screw in hook on the bottom of the speaker with a metal one provided with the base. Then you plug in the base w/ provided cord from the speaker (micro USB). Just sit the speaker on top of the prongs on the base and it charges wirelessly and automatically (also it will turn on automatically, so if you don't want it on you'll have to turn it back off) The only other items to check are the Alexa features. I already have one so if you do too, make sure you keep them in separate rooms. Otherwise they will both play the same thing at the same time when you activate them. The main difference I notice with this speaker Alexa ability vs my original one, is this is a speaker first, so it is connecting to a device to play music from there primarily. When I tried to access online amazon stations it would not do so and would pull from my Google Play phone radio stations instead. This may be an issue with my Amazon music account that doesn't allow additional devices without changing plans. So if you want full function and this is not your only Amazon Alexa device you may have to change your account/plan settings to add a speaker. If this is your only Alexa device then it may work as expected.Size and shape it is about the same as my Amazon Alexa in size/shape and weight. There is no volume spin control, only up/down buttons.Great speaker, okay Alexa, volume adjustments could be a little more responsive.",3.0,492,0.1423789173789174,0,9,1,0.028810541310541282,-0.05787967830556773,-1
"MegablastSetup:I encountered firmware update issues during setup - so I had to continue setup & go back to update (took a few times, then was finally successful).Usage / Buttons:You have to be dead center on the large buttons. At the top of the 'volume down' - it feels like you're hitting a button (feels springy), but you're not - you have to go lower and the volume will decrease. The 'volume up' will accept a lower press to raise the volume. Unlike my $99 Wonderboom, you can't pair more of these speakers that are ~3x the price for a better surround sound. Say whaaat?The sound is a typical UE sound - it's really clean & bassy. It's heavy, but it's grippy & portable - I dig it. It has its own independent sound control - so, raising / lowering volume doesn't change the phone's volume as some devices do (which is where you run into the volume being too low - or just a bit too loud). I've had this before & it's nice that the Megablast is not following that example. Charging the unit appears to make you put it on its side to get to the connector and there's no way it'll be able to stand once you hook up the USB cable. Enter the ""POWER UP"" charging dock - which gives you a replacement nut at the bottom allowing standing charging & use. It's an extra $40 or so, but is worth it, should you really use this a ton & don't want the aggravation.Bluetooth Usage:If you're streaming via bluetooth and ask Alexa a question, it kills the bluetooth connection & doesn't auto-reconnect to continue playing.There are Bluetooth reconnect issues too - I use a few BT devices, even a UE Wonderboom, so it's not my first rodeo. If I disconnect from those, I can reconnect without issue. With this Megablast, sometimes I have to cycle Bluetooth on my phone & then it works. And I'll hear some static during the reconnect too, which is odd. ""Alexa"" Features:Voice recognition is 4/5 times successful for acknowledging that it heard me. Via the UE App, you can toggle the 'microphone off' - so it's not always listening (small red light appears on the top at the bluetooth button). There is no tone to let you know it has heard the wake word (it should be an option at least), but the top light blinks.It can't tell how much battery remains: ""I don't have a battery.""As of Mid-November 2017, there was no Pandora integration yet - though it responds like it's getting my station - but voices an error. There must be an update coming soon (fingers crossed!).It doesn't work well with Amazon Prime Music. It says it's going to shuffle my collection, but it pauses for a long time and then only sometimes starts playing, then cuts out.Smart-ish Home Thoughts ... I could control my HUE lights via room names & the ever finicky Harmony Hub without issue, just as my Tap does - no issues seen here. So, the recommendation is a ""yes"" for the sound - you just need to be patient & hope that these 'smart' quirks get worked out soon.",4.0,535,0.16902998236331573,1,16,1,0.2154850088183422,-0.07979812172431455,-1
"If this were a 'NEW' device I would perhaps write a lengthy review but instead it is the fusion/upgrade of a product that has been around for a few years. My best friend received the original Echo back when it first launched and it was pretty sweet though something I didn't really feel the need to own especially since I didn't think it was THAT great of a speaker. I have several Bluetooth speakers but I am always looking for the next and best. With the Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST I feel like I have found that speaker.The UE MEGABLAST (you just have to put that in all caps), is an outstanding Bluetooth speaker. It is by far, the clearest and probably loudest speaker I have every owned (minus my old component system back in the day). Add to that the Alexa functionality and it makes this a no-brainer. I do a lot of cooking and my wife likes to bake so to now have a speaker that we can command with our voices and can fill the entire lower floor of our house with great music, is a wonderful thing. I probably won't be using all of the features of Alexa but I have already enjoyed checking the local traffic and weather in the mornings before heading out to work.I'm betting I will also never have the opportunity to fully test out the waterproofing since I plan to keep this inside most of the time and I don't have a pool, but since it is in the kitchen I at least don't have to worry about it getting splashed.Set-up was a breeze. I didn't even do it the right way and was still up and running in less than 5 minutes. I plugged in the MEGABOOM and paired it with my iPhone and the phone prompted me to download the Ultimate Ears app, once that was downloaded it did a quick 30 sec firmware update and I was ready to sign into my Amazon account. 20 seconds later I had the speaker jamming out some Def Leppard and I was good.I HIGHLY recommend the Power Up base accessory since it makes it a lot easier to keep this thing charged since you just have to leave or drop it on the dock. The white base is nice and I actually didn't even have to use the 'brick' that the MEGABLAST came with, I just have the USB cord going into a power port built into my plug outlet. No muss and no fuss. When I want to take it outside or to the beach I can just grab it and go and know that it is charged up. UE says that you can get 16 hours on a charge and I have yet to test that out but it has gone strong for over 7 so far.If you have been thinking about getting an Alexa capable device and have been holding off, don't. Ultimate Ears has created a top notch Bluetooth speaker that deserves to be bought just for that but then ices the cake by adding Amazon Alexa functionality.",5.0,520,0.1892843026538678,0,35,1,0.4053578486730661,-0.11148315396202368,-1
"Ultimate Ears - MEGABLAST Smart Portable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Speaker is definitely a contender for one of the best bluetooth speakers I've ever heard. The sound is crisp, clear, and LOUD. Louder than any other speaker I feel like I've tested. The nice thing about the speaker is that even though it reaches unreached levels of sound, it doesn't get too blown out at the higher levels. Sometimes static and fuzz can occur and I hear none of it. Like the new Bose speakers, the sound is projected in a circular fashion which I absolutely love. Being able to hear the music from any part of the room as if you were right next to it is a great accomplishment. The packaging on the speaker is slick and the unit itself is very robust and heavy. I like the fact that the speaker is waterproof, but it will be a while before I put that to the test. The only real thing that bugged me about the speaker is the APP that the company forces you to use to setup the device. I had issues getting it to recognize the speaker, installing the updates and even pairing with WIFI. Repeatedly I had to restart the app and sometimes it just would not pair with the device at all. Finally I just got it to pair with bluetooth and turned off the app, so as of now I don't use the Alexa function. I don't really use Alexa so it's not a big deal to me, but the hassle from the app itself makes me not even want to try and finish the process. So that to me is the only real detriment to the device. Other than that I think it is a great quality speaker that competes with any of the other bluetooth speakers I've heard out in today's market. You can't go wrong with this one, but I hope they update and fix the bugs in the App soon, cause it hurts the experience!",4.0,336,0.19739304812834227,1,16,1,0.20130347593582887,-0.02976963857050463,-1
"I own quite a few different speakers from portable Bluetooth speakers to home speakers with integrated voice assistants. The UE Megablast tries to be the jack of all trades, but falls a bit short.UNBOXING:The unboxing experience is simple and pleasant. Without getting into too much detail of the packaging, you're greeted with a speaker, a high-quality flat microUSB cable, and an AC adapter. You can also purchase a charging dock separately which will allow you to drop the Megablast onto the dock for charging without fiddling with cables. Additionally, you can continue to use the Megablast while charging.SETUP:To setup the Megablast, I downloaded the Ultimate Ears app on my smartphone and opened it up. After ensuring Bluetooth was enabled on my smartphone, I turned on the Megablast. From there, you can pair using the app or your phone's pairing menu. After pairing over Bluetooth, the app will continue the setup process.The Wi-Fi connectivity setup process is simple, but only if your home network situation is typical. Ultimate Ears recommends having separate SSID's for each network (e.g. MyWiFi 2.4GHz, MyWiFi 5GHz) so that the Megablast doesn't get confused during setup. I found that following this recommendation led to a successful setup for the Wi-Fi connectivity. After selecting your network and entering the password, you're also given the opportunity to login to Amazon Alexa for the voice assistant functionality. The app will also install any firmware updates during this process.APP:Once the setup is complete, the app is very simple. You have the ability to turn off the microphone for Alexa to work, and you have the ability to see the battery status, Wi-Fi connection status, Bluetooth connection status and Alexa sign-in status. You also have the ability to switch Wi-Fi networks, switch Amazon accounts for Alexa integration, or unpair/forget the Megablast. Lastly, you can change the idle-time before shutdown, the speaker language, and toggle firmware auto-updates.MEGABLAST HARDWARE:The Megablast is pretty simple. It has a power button with an LED in it, a pairing button, and volume down/up buttons. And of course, the 360 degree sound people love so much paired with an IP67 water resistance rating for splashes and even a bit of submersion. However, it does not have a 3.5mm jack—a feature found on the smaller UE BOOM.AUDIO QUALITY:Like the BOOM speakers that preceded it, the Megablast has sparkly highs, clear mid-range, and punchy bass. However, the Megablast starts to fall short at the highest volumes, as compression kicks in to prevent clipping/distortion in the bass frequencies. This is due to the fact that the EQ really pushes the bass on the Megablast, but like any other Bluetooth speaker, it can only physically handle so much—so to prevent damage, it compresses the bass at a certain threshhold. When this happens, the bass sounds either anaemic or uncontrolled. I do want to stress that this happens to most portable Bluetooth speakers, and the Megablast far from the worst of them.Despite this, if you're listening to spacious, dynamic music, then the Megablast will sound fantastic at most volumes. I have gotten the chance to listen to progressive rock, metal, acoustic, swing jazz, big band jazz, EDM and more. Music with more dynamic instrumentation really shines on the Megablast. Music with a constantly hot master may start to lose its clarity when the Megablast is set to its highest volumes. But overall, an excellent listening experience.ALEXA INTEGRATION:I'm not a fan of Alexa, personally. I find that switching between Bluetooth and Alexa is not seamless. Once I call out ""Alexa"", the Megablast disconnects from Bluetooth, so I have to pair my phone again if I want to use it. Despite this, you can use Alexa with a limited number of unpopular streaming services. You can control Alexa's volume, but not your Bluetooth volume. You also can't ask for the battery status using Alexa. It helps to think of Alexa as a standalone assistant that knows nothing of its existent in the Megablast. When using Alexa, the ""Megablast"" is irrelevant. It only knows whatever Alexa knows and can only do whatever Alexa can do—except stream from Spotify for some reason. So the lesson here is that if you are using Alexa, don't expect Bluetooth connectivity to resume. Just stick to Alexa's Amazon Music, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn streaming over Wi-Fi. Oh, and just so we're clear, Alexa only works over Wi-Fi.CONCLUSION & FINAL THOUGHTS:So, is it worth the price? I'm not sure. I own portable Bluetooth speakers in the same price range, and the Megablast packs a better sound and more volume, but its Alexa integration is half-baked and its missing the integrated voice that tells the battery status when you hold both the volume up and down buttons at the same time. On top of that, you can't do party mode with multiple Megablasts, you can't do remote power on, and you can't change the EQ. These are all features of the smaller UE BOOM, so I'm rather confused as to why these features aren't available on the Megablast. If you're buying this speaker for the Alexa integration, forget it. But if you want a great Bluetooth speaker with a few missing features compared to its smaller siblings, this could be the one to rock your parties.",3.0,871,0.09364595431668603,0,24,1,0.05317702284165693,-0.13751391838753868,-1
"The new UE Megablast is a newcomer to the UE lineup. Now I have never owned a product in this lineup however I have seen an overall positive impression so I was excited to try it out for myself. This speaker promises omnidirectional sound output, waterproof ability, and the new Amazon Alexa capabilities.What’s In the Box? (The box has a REALLY neat design!)-UE Megablast speaker-Quick Start Guide-Micro USB cable-USB ChargerDesign: The cylindrical design is not new to me however this size is. It is fairly large in length and girth. The speakers are covered with a metal mesh where the two 25mm tweeters, two 55mm drivers, and two 85mm x 50mm passive radiators pass sound through. On the bottom of the speaker is a circular rubber cover protecting the micro usb port for charging. There is also a removable D-ring underneath the speaker which is also used for charging using the optional charging base. (Not included) Up top is the power button which is a straight line that illuminates. The oversized volume buttons were VERY hard for me to locate when I first used the device. Well the end up being RIGHT in front of you. I had a couple comments about the buttons resembling a religious cross. Features:- Rugged Design - Omnidirectional Sound (Fairly new to the market although not my first speaker)- Up to 16 hrs battery life- IP67 rating- STRONG Bluetooth Connection. I was able to go to any corner of my house and the speaker didnt hesitate a bit. Other speakers typically did cut in and out or stop altogether.- Wifi music streaming from IHeartRadio, Amazon Prime Music, and TuneIn Radio through Amazon Alexa. Pandora and Deezer are hopefully coming in the near future. - Integrated Amazon Alexa voice assistantAudio Quality: One thing I noticed as soon as this speaker started to play music was its overpowering volume level ability. This speaker was able to get LOUD! I wasnt expecting such an ability out of something this (relatively) small. Now this isnt the only speaker I have in this price range that can do this but it is the first to do it well. The mids and highs are very sharp. Very little distortion while turning the volume up. The bass however does become slightly distorted and cannot get the same depth as my Addon T3 speaker can. The Addon T3 won awards for sound quality in the past so it doesnt surprise me but it is something to note. The Megablast does get louder than the Addon T3 and is not directional so it has the overall win in my book but I love the classy design and sound quality of the Addon better.Problems: I did have very weird ""Auto"" connection problems with the UE. It would randomly connect to my phone while just sitting on the counter AFTER the speaker was turn off. I found this annoying but it seemed to go away after a couple days. Im also not a huge fan of the fact this came with Amazon Alexa capabilities because you need an Amazon account to participate with the feature but I have a Google Mini that fulfills those need overall. Another problem is the charging brick, its huge! It must be plugged in the TOP outlet for the bottom one to be usable at all. Its way to big... Overall: I think this speaker has very good sound quality and with the omnidirectional sound is a bonus. The waterproofing benefits can be a huge benefit if you plan to take your $300 speaker with you wherever you go but mine will likely stay at home with the occasional outing. A solid speaker I would definitely tell others to take a look at if your in the market.",4.0,627,0.10149621212121213,3,31,2,0.24925189393939395,-0.15918393775569328,-1
"The speaker is amazing. UE makes great products and the Megablast is no different. Quality all the way around. From the packaging to the build quality to the overall sound. A+ across all of those areas. The only thing that left me wanting more, was the Bass. From a speaker this size, I was sort of disappointed in the quality of the Bass.My unit came with the speaker and the table top charging dock. The packaging is incrdible, and makes sure your product is not going to be damaged in any way during delivery/shipping. To cable charge, you simply plug in the supplied USB cable into the bottom of the unit. To charge with the docking station, you simply screw in a charging station cap on the bottom and place directly on top of the charger. The initial charge took quite a long time, and was not fully charged from the factory. But once charged the battery life has been great. UE says a full charge can last 15+ hours, and if you download and connect to the UE App, you can always see how much charge you have left, so you're not stuck with a dead speaker at the wrong time.Setting up the speaker was super fast and simple. Normal bluetooth pairing was immediate to my Note 8. I downloaded the UE App as well and while it looks polished, it felt sort of glitchy. The app recognized the speaker immediately but had trouble running through the rest of the setup. I had to exit the app and start over twice before it let me finish the setup. Not a huge deal to be concerned with, as i'm sure UE will fix the app over time. It's also nice that the speaker can be connected via wi-fi and bluetooth. And you can set it to update itself via wi-fi automatically.Setting up Alexa was also a breeze. Simply go to the Alexa setup in the App and login with your Amazon Alexa account and that's it. Alexa is immediately available on your Megablast. We also have a few Amazon Echos in the home, and using the Megablast with Alexa felt the same as using the Echo device. Speech recognition was very good even from across the room. All the features of Alexa are right here in the Megablast, and portable, unlike a Echo/Echo Plus. I think we'll use the Megablast so much more, simply because we can move it around with us.Build quality is amazing, the speaker is huge and feels very sturdy and almost heavy in the hand. Very nice. The 360 degrees sound field is also great, and you get room filling sound and great volume levels. Sound quality is also very good, as you'd expect from UE. But, from a speaker of this size and build, I honestly expected more Bass. I have numerous bluetooth speakers, some bigger or smaller, some from UE and other brands. Compared to all my other speakers, the Megablast was just ok on Bass response. Don't get me wrong, the Bass is there, and for most it's probably fine. However when listening to bass heavy audio, even when EQ'd, the Bass simply gets compressed and tight, not boomy. i don't think it would be a reason to not get the Megablast, the overall sound of the speaker is amazing, but if you were thinking that a speaker this size would give you over the top Bass, you might be disappointed. Having IP67 weather sealing is nice so you don't have to be worried about getting it wet.A couple things I wish they would have done better; you cannot pair multiple Megablast speakers together in stereo, which for this price and category seems to be a glaring omission, I hope UE fixes that soon. I also wish that the speaker came with a 3.5mm connector, but it does not, wireless all the way, or nothing. When using Alexa, the only way you know Alexa has been triggered is if you're actually looking at the speaker and can see the LED light on top grow brighter, there is no audible tone that tells you Alexa is ready, like when using an Amazon Alexa device.All in all the UE Megablast is an amazing speaker with Amazing features, and integrating Alexa just kicks it up a notch! I'm very impressed with the Megablast overall.",4.0,728,0.19553571428571426,1,22,1,0.20223214285714297,-0.10820297674923163,-1
"I have had several different bluetooth speakers over the years including Anker and Lifepoof. This is my first Ultimate Ears speaker and all I can say is 'Wow!'. Seriously, this speaker is impressive. It is waterproof and drop proof from around 1 meter up. It is solid, fairly heavy, and feels very premium. It has 16 hours of battery life at mid volume and built-in wi-fi for Alexa use. Let's start with audio quality since that is why you buy a bluetooth speaker. It is nothing short of marvelous in that department. Easily the best sounding bluetooth speaker I have ever heard. Great highs, mids, and very acceptable lows. The two 55mm drivers coupled with the two tweeters do a remarkable job filling a room with clear, musical sound. Plus, this thing gets VERY loud. It easily fills my first floor with sound. Even at max volume there is minimal distortion with bass heavy music which is a real plus. Once you install the app on your mobile device you can get Alexa up and running in no time. I have several Alexa enabled devices in my home ranging from Hue lights and Harmony remote controls to vacuums and sprinkler system. It works them all just like an Echo and the mic easily picks me up from the other side of my house even (albeit at a raised voice). I also have the charging base which is a must in my opinion if you plan to use the Alexa controls as well as keep it portable too. It's a shame the base doesn't come with it for the price.Overall, I can't recommend this speaker enough. Yes, it is pricey, but you get what you pay for in this case. Outside of a Sonos speaker (which isn't truly portable) I haven't heard a better battery powered Alexa enabled speaker (bluetooth or not). It really is fantastic.",5.0,315,0.1582478632478633,1,8,1,0.4208760683760684,-0.004191583517819675,-1
"I’ve used multiple Bluetooth speakers in my years and I would say that the MEGABLAST rates right up there in the top.The most important feature to me off the bat is the music quality. I listen primarily to classic rock and heavy metal and the highs on the output were very crisp. The bass was very punchy and pronounced but I felt at times that the the low end wasn’t filling in on louder volumes (full disclosure, I tend to listen to music loud!)When I listened to acoustic songs, the crisp sound sounded beautiful and it was a very pleasurable experience.The unit structure itself is incredible solid. I like when electronics have a dense feel, the only thing I would say is that it actually packs some weight behind it! I also found the battery life to be phenomenal!The app itself is a little cumbersome in the flow of things while using an iPhone, and other apps didn’t stream out (like Instagram videos), but maybe there’s a little more tweaking I have to go through.This is the first time that Uve really used Alexa and I have to say I just might try it more and more! The microphone picked up my voice pretty easily (even while playing music at my high volunes) which was a huge plus!Overall I recommend anyone looking for a solid and rugged base, nice sounding music, and especially if you are hooked into Amazon’s Alexa!",4.0,240,0.1825198412698413,6,13,1,0.20874007936507943,-0.0550316966116009,-1
"PROS:-Waterproof design-Easy setup-Great battery life-Great sound qualityCONS:-Price-No hands-free SpotifySUMMARY: If you’re looking for a great sounding battery powered water resistant Alexa enabled speaker and don’t mind the cost or lack of full Spotify support this is the speaker you have been looking for.REVIEW:There is a lot to love about this speaker - the straight forward styling, the easy discovery and setup, and great quality audio. The Megablast is essentially an upgraded version of the Megaboom and it gets even better with the addition of Alexa support. Setup is dead simple. You download the Ultimate Ears app and launch it and it will automatically discover the speaker if it’s already turned on. It will ask for your wifi information and then your Amazon account to setup Alexa if you like. It's dead simple. You can still skip this if you would prefer to use just Bluetooth. It will also check for updates, so the speaker software can improve over time. Hopefully this means we will see support for more music services.The design is what I have come to expect from the UE line. It has the same woven cloth mesh all the way around with large rubber volume buttons. It’s waterproof so you can take this to the beach or let it float in the bathtub at home.The audio quality is top notch. Sound is clear with punch bass that is impressive in a portable speaker. It's just an all around solid sounding speaker. The voice control for music works great especially if you are an Amazon Prime Music user. If you are a Spotify user unfortunately there is not full support, so you won't be using your voice to play any tracks from the service. Since this is just like any Echo device you can control any smart home devices, set timers, as for the weather, etc. The Megablast’s microphone’s are sensitive enough to pick up my voice, but if the music is turned up loud and I am more than 20-30 feet away I will have to yell for it to hear me. If you want privacy you can disable the mic from the app, though it would have been nice to have a physical button like most other voice assistant enable devices. Finally, there is a nifty dock to enable easy charging. Just swap the connector on the bottom and set the speaker on the platform.",5.0,398,0.2261904761904762,0,4,1,0.38690476190476186,-0.010788847343316199,-1
"I own a Google Home and I have played around with an Amazon Echo at my local Best Buy. Both are really good personal assistant devices but I was frankly underwhelmed by each device’s audio quality particularly when it comes to music playback. As a result I was excited to get the Ultimate Ears Megablast with the expectation of exceptional sound quality. The Megablast come nicely packaged and includes a power adapter, a usb cable, and some basic instructions. You need the Ultimate Ears app from either the Apple app store or the Google Play store to complete setup. Within the app one simply connects the Megablast to your WiFi network, pair Bluetooth devices, and sign into your Amazon account and you’re up and running. Can’t beat that for simplicity. I started off by asking Alexa some standard personal assistant questions like the time and weather then quickly moved on to music. I have an Amazon Music Unlimited account so I start requesting songs. I pump up the volume using the + control on the side of the device and I’m quickly blown away by the sound quality emanating from the Megablast. I put it through it paces by requesting various music selections from rock, to jazz, to classical. What a treat! Great music reproduced with great quality by simply asking Alexa. Deep bass and clean rich highs filled my house. Even on the max volume there was no distortion. This thing rocks. One disappointment I discovered which you should be aware of if you use Amazon Music Unlimited. Amazon offers a reduced pricing option called Amazon Echo monthly which limits your account to just one Echo device. It appears that this plan is only available on Echo devices and not on licensed devices such as the Megablast. I hope this changes in the future since Amazon support was even surprised that it didn’t work. I should point out another discovery that the Megablast powers off when not in use. I thought initially that this was a disappointing limitation for a personal assistant device until I found the setting in the app to change this auto sleep feature in time increments of 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 Hour, 3 hours, or never. You will get 16 hours of constant use on the never sleep setting. Impressive! Buyers should note that Ultimate Ears also sells a great charging dock accessory for the Megablast called the Ultimate Ears Power Up. This let’s you leave it on at all time while also maintaining a full charge for when you want to take the Megablast with you. When you do the unit is big but is still quite portable. I was happy to learn that the Megablast is also water resistant. Not only that but you could immerse in water up to 3 feet deep for 30 minutes. Why you would want to submerge such an expensive device is beyond me but hey you can if you want. As I used the device for several days one issue stood out. While the Magablast boasts a multiple microphone design with beam forming technology I found myself constantly repeating myself to get Alexa to respond. Very frustrating. I’m hoping that this is improved with a firmware update. Other than this one issue I was truly impressed by the Ultimate Ears Megablast. I would definitely recommend particularly for music lovers seeking excellent sound quality.",4.0,567,0.19200520833333334,2,19,1,0.20399739583333343,-0.11515992877239334,-1
"This speaker is loud. From the tech specs, the speaker has a max output of 93 decibels, which is a 40% increase, can I tell if it is 40% louder, not sure but I can be a good 30-50 feet and have no problems hearing the speaker when I compared it to other Bluetooth speakers that I had. For me the sound reaches everywhere in my back yard and my back yard is about a half acre. It has 360 coverage and it really didn't matter where I was in my back yard, the music sounded great from all angles. It sounds very clear and doesn't have that muddy sound you hear on other speakers when you turn up the volume all of the way. Wifi is rated at 330 feet for wifi and 150 for Bluetooth. I could reach a signal anywhere in my yard and I had a solid Bluetooth connection from 35 feet or so. No drop outs and the sound was great. Battery life is good. One thing I like is that the charger is wireless charging dock so I could really charge the speaker anywhere I went and it gave it a nice base to keep off the table. The battery is rated for 16 hours and I got close to that, but I was near a strong wifi signal and I kept the volume level at about half. I am not sure what happens to the battery life if it is not near a strong wifi signal, but battery life does take a hit if you play at max levels. Alexa is built in so you get hands free access to music services such as Amazon music, iHeartRadio and TuneIn. It looks like Pandora and Deezer will work in the near future. You get access to other Alexa services such as news, weather, auidiobooks, voice control for IoT devices, general questions and 25,000 Alexa commands. Set up is through a new UE app which connects your wifi network and links you Amazon account for the Alexa functions. Since the speaker is WiFi capable, the speaker will get updates quickly for Alexa functions. One of the benefits about being connected to wifi is now your music won't stop when someone is calling you. The Pros:More durable and portable version of the EchoMuch louder and clearer than an EchoSounds much clearer at loud levels, doesn't sound muddyIP67 water resistant. Alexa is always listening no more having to press a button Some Cons:There is no head phone jack, I know not everyone uses one and a speaker is typically so everyone can hear it, but some people will want the earphone access. Can't link older UE speakers and for now you can only play music through one Megablast at a time. Right now only Amazon Music, iHeartRadios and TuneIn are available for streaming music directly. Pandora and Deezer are set to be in the future. So if you use Apple music or Spotify you are out of luck. Can't make Alexa phone calls. I really like this speaker, one of the better sounding ones at full volume. If you need a loud, great sounding portable speaker that has Alexa functions built in so you can be hands free and is water resistant, this is the speaker for you.",5.0,551,0.16624990161353798,0,18,1,0.41687504919323104,-0.08495267131998874,-1
"I own and have used the Ultimate Ears Boom speaker that I've had for the past 5-6 years or so and it has been my favorite bluetooth speaker I've ever had. After hearing about this new Ulimate Ears MEGABLAST speaker, I was thrilled and couldn't wait to receive it in the mail. I knew this would be my new permanent replacment for my aging BOOM speaker, with the increasingly dwindling battery. But, a few bugs and inconsistencies keep it from exceeding my expectations. It'll still be my new daily-use speaker.First of all, let me explain why the original UE BOOM was my favorite speaker. I've got some hearing loss issues and my right ear has only about 15% hearing (it's really only good for picking up bass, lol). So, when I choose a new speaker or pair of headphones/earbuds, they have to be able to get loud enough for a comfortable level for me, but yet even louder when I want to ""crank"" it. I use all my bluetooth devices on my iPad Pro 10.5"" and my new iPhone X. The BOOM speaker has never failed me. I watch Twitch.tv daily, usually for about 6 hours on average while I do my work. I've used my BOOM for many years like this and I've only kept the volume up between the 3-4 notch (this is maybe 1/3 the max volume on the device volume bar) for everything I listen to and never had an issue hearing.So, I was definitely excited to get this. I couldn't wait to unbox it, get it charged and synced to my devices! Let's break it down.Packaging:This was where I was most impressed. The packaging on the outside didn't look like anything fancy. But, it's when you break the seal and pull the slip-cover off the box... The inside box the speaker is housed in is made of a super thick and durable cardboard and I was totally not expecting the amazing artwork! It's so bright and colorful and I immediately thought - they've put a lot of love into this making and designing this speaker and box. Inside the box, the cylindrical speaker is nestled in perfectly curved black styrofoam and matches everthing else. It's very snug and secure. Along with the speaker, you also get the normal, minimal instructions (it's a bluetooth speaker, not rocket science), USB power cable and the larger-than-my-old-one power brick. The cable and brick are both white, perfectly contrasting with the black speaker.Design:This speaker looks nearly identical to my old one, aside from a few minor color differences and the obvious fact that it is MUCH bigger. The top of the speaker has the power button and the bluetooth sync button. On the front, non-mesh part of the speaker are the + and - buttons for the volume. Then, down at the very bottom...ON the bottom, lies the flip-up waterproofing rubber flap. You have to pull this up in order to get to the USB charge port and Power LED charge indicators. This flap was a little tighter to pull up than I would have liked (I thought I was going to rip it once...) and you definitely have to pull it back a bit with some force in order to plug the charge cable into it. The only other negative to this is given the fact that all this is on the bottom of the speaker, you have the lay it down on it's side while it is charging. Again, the same as my old one. But...you know, round things...well, they roll. Aside from this, I absolutely love the tall, cylinder shape of the speaker and the minimal amount of space it takes!App:Once I got the speaker fully charged, I was able to connect it via Bluetooth to my iPad Pro 10.5"" (my primary Twitch.tv watching device) without fail. I downloaded the app designed for the BLAST range of speakers. It looks really nice and has all the normal options I'd expect. The app detected the speaker and after I entered my WiFi password, it even automatically updated the firmware. It then asked me to activate Alexa and log into my Amazon account, which I was able to do without any problems...then gave me a code for a few months free of Amazon Music. I use Spotify myself, but still - not a bad gesture. After the inital setup, the app displays the current battery level in a bar-style format (not a percentage), confimration of WiFi connection and Alexa on/off, as well as the link to my Amazon account. Other than that, it's pretty basic, but gives you the information you need.However, my major issue with the battery level on this speaker is that you can ONLY view it through the app. My old BOOM speaker displayed the battery at the top of my device, as well as in my Battery Widget. This speaker does neither. It just shows that ""headphone"" icon at the top of my device with no battery indicator and does not appear anywhere in my Batteries info in settings or the Widget. I'm hoping this is just a software bug and will be fixed in a later update, as it's quite annoying coming from my BOOM speaker that does show this. Then again, it could be intentional since you can just ask Alexa ""what's my battery at?""...Bluetooth/Alexa/Sound:I'm tying these final three into one category because it's seems that they are all somehow related together and where my biggest concerns are. This is where the the bugs and inconsistencies hide, aside from my issue with the Battery indicator above. The bluetooth has EXCELLENT range, but it doesn't appear to be flawless, like I'm used to with other Ultimate Ear products. When it has a connection, it's great and solid. No cut-outs or any other weird sound artifacts. However, I've had a few instances where the bluetooth connection would just drop for no reason. This seemed a little inconsistent, with no rhyme or reason for it. Completely random. I have to manually go into settings and select the MEGABLAST speaker to connect it again.This is my first Alexa enabled device! So, I was definitly excited to give it a try. Initially, Alexa was a joy to use. I started with all the obvious stuff you would ask something like Alexa or Siri. ""How's the weather today?"" granted me exactly what I wanted to hear, plus more in a voice that I found rather pleasing compared to say, Siri. Alexa just seems much more natural and non-robotic. Then I go on with having her tell me a joke, rap, etc, etc. All works great. But...I discovered an issue with using Alexa while playing music or any audio already coming through the speaker. When the speaker is playing audio and you issue an Alexa command...when she's done...the bluetooth connection just.........DROPS. Every. Single. Time. I have to go into settings and reconnect. So, the only time I can use Alexa is when the speaker isn't being used. Which then, I've more than likely got it turned of. Very disheartening as I really wanted to implement Alexa into my music, smart thermostat, etc. I'm really hoping this is just a bug and can/will be fixed in a sooner-than-later firmware update.As for sound, I found a lot of inconsistencies there as well. When playing music or other audio, I noticed I had to turn this speaker up louder than my BOOM to get the same level of volume out of it. I have to use my MEGABLAST at about half volume to get it at the same sound level as 1/3 volume of my BOOM. Which is weird because...isn't this supposed to be the loudest speaker they offer? It appears this speaker does better at mid to higher level volumes than lower to mid level. I initially thought that the ""max"" volume of the speaker was independant of the volume I have on my device because I could say ""Alexa, change the volume to 10"" and the volume bar on my device would stay the same, but the speaker would be much louder. But then...when I raise or lower the volume a notch on the device, the speaker volume would change to match that. Another issue I noticed...the speaker outputs the audio that is being played...but none of my other device sounds. Unlike my boom, I don't can't hear the keyboard typing sound, any text or e-mail notification sounds, etc. I've even turned the ""Sounds"" volume on my device up to the max with no results. But the audio being played is normal. I cannot figure this out to save my life.I didn't get to test the bluetooth phonecall quality during use because my BRAND NEW iPhone X that I've had for less than 15 days decided to bite the dust on me (the touch screen quit working...hardware defect) and I'm currently awaiting a replacement from my carrier.Conclusion:So, there you have it. So far, I have a love/hate relationship with this speaker. The volume inconsistencies are killing me and Alexa is all but useless since my bluetooth connection drops every time I use her. I also really with there was a battery level displayed on the device like my BOOM has, but the only way to see it with the MEGABOOM is via the app. These are my big 3 issues with the speaker and why I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 stars. The only thing saving it from 3 stars is the amazing sound of the actual audio that is being played...as long as it's above half (5) on the volume level.Now, I did reach out to Logitech (the manufacturer of the Ultimate Ears brand) on Twitter earlier in the week. Several days have passed since then (which is why I waited a bit on my review) and I haven't heard anything back from them. I'll e-mail support about this I guess, when I get my phone back. But I really expected some sort of response or follow-up from them regarding this. Oh well. I should dock a star for this, but I won't.",4.0,1685,0.13578782328782324,4,80,1,0.23210608835608837,-0.20694264758846004,-1
"Compared to Amazon’s Echo, this speaker offers better sound quality. The midrange is very crisp and clear and makes vocals really stand out. When I listened to some of my Diana Krall playlist, her vocals sounded very intimate like she was singing right in front of me.Setup was very easy, you just plug it in and download and install the Ultimate Ears App for your phone/tablet and the app searches for and connects to the speaker after which you can set it up.To set up the speaker to connect to your wifi network, the app did require me to type in my wifi password which can be a pain on a phone/tablet if you have a long password. I’ve seen other apps that have the ability to automatically set up the password without the user having to type it in (after all the phone/tablet already knows the password if it is on your wifi network)My speakers came with a charging dock that is a must have accessory. It normally costs $39.99. Just sit your speaker on the charging dock and it will start charging. You don’t have to fumble around to flip the rubber tab hiding the usb port to charge the speaker.To set up your speaker to use the charging dock, you unscrew the original black plug on the bottom of the speaker and replace it with a shiny metallic plug that makes contact with the charging pins on the dock. I do wonder if the speaker is still as waterproof with the shiny metallic plug since water would be able to touch the charging rings on the plug.After you set up the speaker, you can use the standard Alexa app to fine tune the Alexa part of the speaker. One thing I noticed is that you can’t change the wake up word for the MegaBlast to anything else (Amazon, Computer etc.). It will only respond to Alexa. Also, some services like Spotify aren’t available yet but that didn’t bother me since I mostly use Amazon Music. So, basically, it seems like the MegaBlast doesn’t currently support all the features of the Amazon Echo. Hopefully, future firmware upgrades will fix this.The top of the speaker is slightly concave with a light bar that lights up when it recognizes a voice command. Compared to the Echo and Echo Dot, I found myself having to repeat myself a lot more before the MegaBlast would respond to my voice commands. Because of this, I don’t think it’s microphones are as good as those in the Echo. To make matters worse, it’s sometimes hard to know if it recognizes the wake up word because it can be difficult to see the light at the top of the speaker if the speaker is located at or above eye level.I had no problems using it as a bluetooth speaker. Pairing with my phone/tablets was easy and I always had a strong connection with no drop-outs.In summary, the MegaBlast is a stellar portable bluetooth speaker that offers superior sound quality over most competing bluetooth speakers. As an Alexa smart speaker, it falls a little short of a real Amazon Echo with regards to command recognition and it currently doesn’t support all the features of a real Amazon Echo. Hopefully future firmware upgrades will rectify some of these shortcomings.",4.0,552,0.20039930555555552,0,7,1,0.19980034722222229,-0.05195670674318653,-1
"Sporty, Loud, waterproof, and most importantly it has Amazon Alexa. This Bluetooth speaker has far been my favorite on the go speaker, I've owned several Bluetooth speakers, and this has far been my favorite sound wise and looks wise. I got the black option. It's discreet and simple just like a speaker should be. It's larger than your average Bluetooth speakers (Height: 9.3 inches, Width: 3.5, and Weights about 3 pounds).To use Amazon's Alexa, you will need to download the “Ultimate Ears” app and sign on with your amazon prime account (if applicable), you will also connect to your WIFI with this app other than that it’s a basic app with minimal features. Nothing stands out in this app. To really customize your Alexa experience, you will also need to download the Amazon Alexa app once again log in with your amazon prime account, you can enroll to other music services (Spotify – Must have Premium, Pandora – Basic Account okay, Tune In – No acct needed, and Iheartradio) so you can command Alexa to play these music apps by voice command.The sound coming out of this Bluetooth speaker is great! It’s loud, loud enough for my 1-bedroom apartment. The highs are nice, but when playing it loud the lows drown out a little bit, it’s not really on the bass heavy side but that doesn’t take away from the clear sound this speaker has. It didn’t bother me at all. It really sounds great! I also recommend that you also include the Charging Dock with the speaker, it’s roughly 40 dollars and it’s well worth it! It’s make the charging effortless, you just place the speaker on top of the dock and automatically starts charging. I placed the charging dock next to my bed so when I wake up I just turn it on, command Alexa to play my favorite music apps or tune in (talk shows), ask what’s the traffic time to work is, and turn it off when I leave to work. I like that the company includes a 2-year warranty, better than the average 1-year warranty. The battery life is 16 hours which is more than enough for your music needs. I haven’t tried the water-resistant feature, but it states it can be immersed in “liquid” up to 1 meter for up to 30 minutes. Overall, I really like this speaker, and all speakers should be like this product moving forward. It’s really a great Bluetooth speaker and I normally don’t like paying North of 200 dollars for a speaker, but this speaker is worth it and recommend to anyone!!",5.0,434,0.20184294871794872,5,11,7,0.39907852564102564,-0.13314656701757743,-1
"There are great bluetooth speakers, great Amazon Echo devices, and now something that combines both. I've been using a couple of Echo Dots for over a year now and have gotten hooked on using them for home automation as well as listening to news, football games, and music. I had been using an external bluetooth speaker with each in order to make the music sound tolerable. I've now replaced the Dot and speaker combo in the kitchen with the MegaBlast and it's perfect!Here are some features I really like:o I keep it sitting on the charging disk so it's powered on and ready to move if I want to take it with me while washing cars or working in the yard.o It's waterproof so I don't have to worry about splashing it in the kitchen or yard.o It says the battery will last 16 hours which is way longer than I want to be doing yard work.o The sound quality is fantastic. It's really clear even at high volume with no distortion that I can detect. It never sounded ""muddy"" or ""tinny"" like some speakers.o A nice perk is that it comes with 3 months of free Amazon Music Unlimited. I have Prime, but there are occasionally songs I've wanted that are only in the Unlimited service. It'll be nice to try it out and see how much I use it.There is really only one slight negative with the speaker that I found. The indicator light on top is recessed, and this is the light that lets you know if Alexa is listening to you. If you're across the room, sometimes you don't have a high enough angle to see the light and I found that annoying. I guess I really did get used to watching the light ring on the Echo Dot so I miss being able to see that across the room. However, I think the quality speaker sound more than makes up for that loss. It's great to have Alexa in a portable, waterproof, quality speaker.",5.0,339,0.2622222222222223,1,16,1,0.3688888888888888,-0.03189625705522414,-1
"Hands down, this is the best bluetooth speaker I've heard. Since everyone's listening tastes differ, you mileage may vary. There's more than enough bass (tight and slightly ""punchy"" that you can feel) and the mids/highs are more pronounced and crisp. And, with any speaker, the quality that goes in is reflected in the quality that comes out. So, your Spotify extreme downloads will sound better than the music ripped from Napster in 2002. There's more than enough headroom to overwhelm a small (12x12) room but a large room wouldn't be a problem, either. As it's winter in my locale, I haven't tested outdoor results but fidelity will obviously be lost, as is the case with any speaker, absent any reflective surfaces.Yeah, it's a fairly large speaker but I'd have no problem putting it into a carry-on to accompany me on a vacation. Solid build and finish.I put this up against BB's standard aisle fare and it really stood out for me with its superior sound. I walked into the store expecting to buy the large Bose Revolve+ but didn't like its sound characteristics nearly enough. That may be the right speaker for you so take the opportunity to do an in-store listen before purchasing. The other UE offerings just didn't have the clarity and sound I wanted although others can be paired up for stereo sound which would make a difference. In the end, I just wanted one speaker and this was it.And, if you want a decent carry case, search Amazon for telephoto camera lens bags. I think mine (JJC) was about $12 and carries the charge cable and wall wart with the speaker with ease. What can be improved:Wi-fi connectivity is spotty. For whatever reason it stopped connecting to my primary wi-fi network but has no problem with the guest one. Go figure.The microphones aren't nearly as sensitive as my Alexa devices. In fact, I have to raise my voice enough that other devices pick up the requests, too.Bluetooth doesn't autoconnect in the app. It's just a couple clicks but I can be listening to music, open the app, and it won't find the speaker until I select it in the menu. Dumb.The recharge port is kinda' in a dumb place, on the bottom, protected by a threaded cover. Makes sense for durability but I'm sure more than one owner will lose his/her cover or threaded bolt.UE could stand to add an EQ setting in the app but I'm running EQ Pro on my Android and that launches automatically so NBD. Still, it would be nice if a speaker manufacturer had the forethought to allow customizing its products' sound without going third-party. Again, just a nit but I like messing with the sound.Good luck with your search and happy listening!",5.0,462,0.21177248677248683,1,14,1,0.3941137566137566,-0.046041287881157245,-1
"Ultimate Ears - MEGABLAST is a stunning portable speaker with Alexa built-in. I own several Voice-Controlled Personal Assistants, so I am very familiar with Alexa's capabilities & will compare UE MEGABLAST accordingly.LIKES: 1- Bass output is second to no other device with Alexa onboard. Nothing is even close. Put your hand near the side when it is rocking & feel the air from the woofers & passive radiators! Bass sounds like a quality 8"" woofer! 2- High frequencies are crystal clear, noticeably more musical than the average Voice-Controlled Personal Assistant, which is an impressive accomplishment.3- Waterproof to 1 meter for 30 minutes.4- Long lasting built-in rechargeable Li-ion battery rocks out up to 16 hours between charges!5- Built-in equalization emulates ""Loudness On"". Bass is always leading & high frequencies are above the midrange. The equalization has been finely tuned & is not adjustable.6- Bluetooth Input permits sound from any Bluetooth source. This is exceptionally handy in areas with no Wi-Fi.7- Very rugged case is perfect for portable use.8- Syncs with other Alexa equipped devices; they all answer questions, play the news, announce sports, weather, route time to work & other traditional Alexa functions.9- Automatic updates arrive via Wi-Fi to improve performance over time. 10- Uses the tried-and-true Alexa app.11- Voice command most smart home devices.12- 360 degree sound is much more obvious than in the average Voice-Controlled Personal Assistant, due to the multiple premium quality tweeters & the sound has a spread matrix stereo effect. It really sounds like there are 2 speakers in the room. In addition to the more forward bass & articulate highs, this spread stereo sound is stunning.13- The charging base (optional & sold separately) makes charging as simple as sitting the speaker on a round disk. Highly recommended!14- Auto off after a period of time when the music has stopped to save the battery. Or with the Charging Base, it converts to always on, always listening for ""Alexa"" command. 15- Plays extremely loud! 93dB rated output!16- No audible distortion in the bass, even at high SPL's!17- The light on the top shows status / battery / Alexa command following & many more items. 18- Very easy to set-up with both Ultimate Ears & Alexa Apps. 19- Works great with Amazon Prime Music - simply name a song, or ask to stream music by your favorite artist.20- Expert, reliable control of HUE Lights & many Home Automation Devices.21- Most beautiful packaging of any consumer productI have ever seen.22- Standard 1/4""-20 tripod thread on the bottom makes for flexible placement.CONCERNS: 1- ""Alexa Lite"" best describes the reduced capability of the personal assistant. Having numerous Voice-Controlled Personal Assistant devices already, the differences jumped out: No Sirius XM, Spotify or Pandora Streaming; no ""Amazon"" wake-up name option (only Alexa); no voice confirmation when you call out ""Alexa"", though the light on top indicates Alexa has been queried, if you happen to look in that direction. 2- Equalization (bass / midrange / treble balance) is not user adjustable, though it comes factory set to produce amazing sound.3- No 3.5mm audio input jack to hardwire sound from an external device to maintain clear audio. Bluetooth is a limited fidelity transmission, and this speaker is so good, that really shows. Streaming sound from Prime Music, for example, sounds stunning; streaming from your phone or tablet by Bluetooth lacks the dynamic range, bass punch & high frequency clarity and sounds just ""O.K.""4- Pairing 2) MEGABLAST speakers for Right / Left stereo sound is not possible as of this test. However, this feature may appear via a future automatic Software update. CONCLUSION: If you are an audiophile, BUY MEGABLAST!! You will not believe your ears if you stream music from Amazon Prime or other high quality streaming sources. Avoid Bluetooth for audio purity reasons. Sound quality vs. cost make this device an absolute STEAL for audiophiles!!However, if you prioritize the maximum capability of the Voice-Controlled Personal Assistant over sound quality, then other, less costly devices may better meet your expectations.MEGABLAST far exceeded my expectations & earned my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!!",5.0,674,0.19216099773242623,13,15,1,0.40391950113378683,-0.16013591766007096,-1
To start off sound is super objective to the individual listening so I'm not saying I'm a sound aficionado just going to tell you how it sounds to me. First thing that you need to talk about with this unit is the unboxing experience. The manufacturer made it a fun experience with a quality feeling EVERYTHING! Once you get past that you see all its features and I was excited. I booted mine while it was on it's wireless charger to find my first pro and con. Alexa is great if you have amazon music which to be fair Logitech gives you a trail of it to get you started. I don't listen to my music from Amazon and didn't like that I was forced into because my music service was not supported. Asking basic things like paus stop or next track are fun but I noticed that when I used the Alexa side it disconnected the Bluetooth side... every... single... time. So I stopped using it for that and just focused on sound quality. Unfortunately this was a tall order on this unit. I felt the sound had a incredible amount of treble which hurt me even at 50% volume. My phone luckily supports a great equalizer built in and I tweaked it to sound good but not great. For how much you invest in a unit like this I felt like they fell short. It has a lot of things to love like the basic waterproofing it offers and wireless charging to make everything super simple but to me those are cool/gimmicky. To summarize if water proof speaker is what your looking for with wireless charging then I would say this is probably the best one. If your looking for the best sound you can get I would say maybe something else.Thank you for taking the time to read my review and I hope it helped a little in your decision. Good Luck!,3.0,325,0.27805451127819547,2,14,1,0.0390272556390977,-0.061593018647973174,-1
"This speaker is very impressive!! Probably the key thing to know is that the sound is of great quality and it's loud just like the first generation and I'd say this one tops that! It's almost hard to believe you can get that kind of sound out of a small portable speaker but you do with this one. Coupled with it you have Amazon's Alexa built in so it makes it versatile on top of just having great sound - a huge advantage over other speakers. It has the ability to connect via WiFi so you can stream audio directly to the speaker and can use Alexa to control it. With Alexa of course, you can do a lot of different things like controlling smart devices such as lights or appliances or simply use it to control audio, get news updates, etc. If you can't connect to WiFi or have it out and about you can connect directly to your phone or tablet to stream your audio directly to the speaker. The design is solid and simple. All in all, I'd very much recommend this speaker if you're looking for a good high quality speaker that is flexible and can be used both at home on the dock and on the go. Pros:Loud high quality sound and bass (quite impressive for it's size!!)Great battery lifeWiFi and Bluetooth ConnectivityOptional charging base makes it easy to chargeMicro USB ChargingExternal controls and can also be voice controlled with AlexaCons:None so far!",5.0,248,0.22826330532212885,6,1,2,0.3858683473389356,-0.05531941928138839,-1
"The UE Megablast is the newest arrival to the UE lineup to offer fantastically crisp and clear audio with strong bass response, with the new addition being the Amazon Alexa voice assistant. With a sleek cylindrical design, waterproofing that allows the speaker to be submersible, and omnidirectional speaker output, the UE Megablast aims to be the only speaker that you need in the home, at the pool, at the party, and everywhere in between. What’s In the Box?-A box with a lot of funky and groovy art (you’ll know what I mean when you slide off the tame looking cover)-UE Megablast speaker-Quick Start Guide-Micro USB cable-USB ChargerAppearance and Build Quality: The all cylindrical design looks very similar to an oversize beer can with a rugged, rubberized exterior shell to handle all the scrapes, bruising, and drops that will occur over its lifetime. The speaker is covered in a hard, fabric-like grill to allow the audio to pass through the two 25mm tweeters, two 55mm drivers, and two 85mm x 50mm passive radiators, all the while keeping dust, moisture, and water from seeping into the interior. On the bottom of the speaker is a circular rubber cover protecting the micro usb port for charging. There is also a removable D-ring underneath the speaker. I assume this D-ring is for hanging the speaker. Up top is the power button and another much smaller button to enable Bluetooth pairing. The very oversized +/- buttons are located along the sides of the cylinder. The button labels for + and – are huge, you’d have to be blind not to notice them. And maybe it is just me, but they do have the visual appearance of resembling a religious cross. Features:+Rugged Design – Take the speaker anywhere indoors and outdoors, but of course don’t subject it to extreme heat or cold. +Omnidirectional sound+Up to 16 hrs battery life – more than enough for a full day of partying assuming you get 8 hrs of sleep to round out a 24 hr day. It will take up to 3 hrs to recharge a fully discharged battery. +IP67 rating – This means this speaker goes beyond simply being cowardly splash proof, but boldly insists on being dunked under water in approximately 3 feet of water for up to 30 minutes. I was too afraid to put this to the test, since I did not want to ruin a $300 speaker. I’ll take UE at their word.+Strong Bluetooth connection. I didn’t experience any Bluetooth stuttering or disconnections. In fact, UE boasts that the Bluetooth range is up to 150 feet. +Wifi music streaming from IHeartRadio, Amazon Prime Music, and TuneIn Radio through Amazon Alexa. Pandora and Deezer are purportedly to be included in the future. +Integrated Amazon Alexa voice assistant. This may or may not be important to you depending on whether or not you are already subscribed to one of the two dominant voice assistant ecosystems (Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant) presently available in the market. Features that are Missing: Equally important to the features (aka “the selling points”) are the features that are missing in the UE Megablast which are offered by some of the competitors in the portable Bluetooth speaker market.-No NFC connection. -No 3.5mm audio jack. I am disappointed, but not surprised. Would have been great if UE included a 3.5mm jack since wired audio quality is still better than Bluetooth transmission audio quality. -You cannot connect two or more UE Megablasts together or to other speakers in the UE lineup via Bluetooth in a party mode to have multiple speakers playing the same music simultaneously. Not sure why UE took this feature off the table. Just imagine how loud your party could get if you could connect them together! Audio Quality: I was impressed by the audio output of the speakers. The omnidirectional (aka 360 degree) sound meant that there are no fading, audio dead spots as I moved about my room. The UE Megablast can get really loud to the point that your neighbors will be knocking on your door to turn it down. The mid-range representing vocals and speech is very crisp and clear. The highs are equally well represented. Bass kicks in strong without overpowering the high and midrange frequencies. This means that when you’re listening to music with strong bass, you can still clearly hear the vocals. And if you choose to watch a movie using the UE Megablast, you can clearly hear the bass response from action sequences, but wouldn’t have to adjust equalizers to hear dialogue. Amazon Alexa Voice Assistant: I’m not going to go too much into this. You are initially asked to connect to Amazon Alexa when you first set up the speaker through the Ultimate Ears app available through the Google Play Store or Apple App store. The microphone does a fine job of picking up audio across my room and I’m able to ask Alexa questions and give it commands. Alexa will only work if the speaker is connected through the wifi network. It will not work on a Bluetooth only connection.If you find yourself desiring some privacy, you have two options to turn off the microphone from listening to your conversation. First method is to open the Ultimate Ears app, tap on the microphone icon, and tap ‘off’ to disable the microphones. A tone will be emitted and a small red light will illuminate at the top of the speaker to indicate that the microphones have been turned off. The second method is to use the speaker controls. On the speaker, press the volume down ‘ – ‘ and the Bluetooth button simultaneously. You will hear a tone and see the red light at the top of the speaker. This indicates that the microphone has been turned off. To turn them back on, press the same buttons again. Finally, one thing to take note. UE did a poor job with the location for the micro usb charging port. The port is located at the bottom base of the speaker. That means when you are charging it, you will have to place the speaker on its side horizontally, which means it has a strong chance of rolling off your table. Or you can place the speaker upside down, with the power button on the bottom. The only other alternative is to purchase the charging dock which will allow you to charge the speaker in the upright position. Conclusion: Do I recommend the UE Megablast? Given its very good audio quality and sleek, rugged build quality, I totally believe it is a sound choice (pun intended) and should be on your short list. However, given that some of the features are noticeably missing which were found in the previous UE lineup (eg. Megaboom) at a lower price point, you will need to really ask yourself if the addition of the Alexa assistant is worth the tradeoff.",4.0,1151,0.06850360036003601,1,29,1,0.265748199819982,-0.1715881992561865,-1
"the good:- sound quality - tons of volume and clarity, and even at high (and i do mean *high* - this little guy pumps out the sound!) volumes very little if any distortion. good spectrum top to bottom, nothing overly forward or distracting. just punchy and fun to listen to.- alexa/wifi integration - the alexa integration may or may not be useful to all. if it is, having a portable speaker of this quality will certainly be a major plus. with an amazon prime music account, you don’t even need another device to play music - “alexa play foo fighters” brought up a nice shuffled mix of foo with nothing else attached to the speaker, even via bluetooth. pretty cool.- design - attractive “360” design, rugged and waterproof-battery life - rated at 16 hours at mid volume, and appears to be accurate.the bad:- pairing issues using my mac - pairing to my iphone was easy and quick, but for some reason pairing to my macbook pro had issues. i was never quite able to just use it as a bluetooth speaker with the laptop as i was with the phone.- can’t keep continuously plugged in w/o the accessory charger - to me it’s a bit of a design flaw, probably necessary to keep the unit water tight, but in any case, the micro usb port is on the bottom of the speaker, meaning you can’t exactly keep it plugged in and charging unless you pay for the accessory charger dock ($40). would’ve been nice to have this ability without the extra cost.overall:i would really like to give this speaker 4.5 stars, but since we are limited in our 5 star review system to only using full stars, i’ll round up and give it 5 stars. the sound quality alone at least justifies that much. just a couple minor issues short of a full 5 stars in my opinion, but highly recommended none the less.",5.0,324,0.15972560975609754,1,0,1,0.42013719512195125,-0.004008067758510259,-1

However, all that's changed and, after just one use, I'd recommend this backpack to anyone.I'm not a professional photographer however, I do want a bag to carry my essentials which include a Canon 30D, 2 lenses, a tripod, a small video camera, a small digital camera for my 8 year old, as well as batteries, extra flashcards, and other small items.

"First of all, this is a great product and does what it is supposed to. But if falls short of true greatness in several areas. I know secure packing is a priority, but none of my issues would affect the protection of the equipment except for clipped on components. I wanted a case like this (I have many others as well) and the security and form factor are what I needed. But this is a photography bag and thus should be designed for photography, not permanent storage.First, as anyone knows whose shooting action whether sports, news or animals, being able to open a bag while juggling lenses, bodies, etc. speed is of the essence. The problem here is not access, but the size and reach of the zippers. The zipper teeth are on the small size and I fear as the zippers go screaming around the corners, their life will be short, especially since they hang up rounding the top corners. They have not jammed or broken yet, but these are zippers are only human. I think a pair of 10 YKKs are in order instead of wimpy small teeth zips with big pulls.My second gripe is with the reach of the zippers. I carry an 80-200 2.8 across the bottom of the pack (it allows me several lens/body choices so I can carry any lens on my D300 with MB-D10 grip (upsidedown from the usual pictures, by the way). The zippers don't quite reach the bottom of the pack so I have to wedge the lens out at unrealistic effort. In fact, much of the diameter of the lens falls below the reach of the zippers. I'm sure there's some reason for this design, but whatever it is escapes me.Oh, I use the small dividers in a way that can flip them sideways or down when not needed and close like a door when needed.Read more",,317,0.08946360153256705,0,12,1,,-0.016096875453426418,-1
"I have found this bag fits most of my field photography needs. The particular attraction was the ability to hold my Canon 450D with Sigma 150-500 attached, room for a 24-70 lens, 430 flash, and the miscellaneous camera gear that goes with me. I bought this item locally rather than via Amazon as camera bags are one of those items (I think) you should not buy sight unseen. Camera bags have to be tested and decided by the user personally - user needs are unique as the bags.I demanded several criteria in a camera bag:1. No more than 100 cost (it's a padded BAG!)2. Capacity for 450D body, battery grip, 150-500 lens attached, short lens (24-70), miscellaneous smaller gear3. Comfortable (naturally)4. Overall bag size should not be larger than a student's book bag.Optional preferences:A. Tether for monopod/tripodB. Preferably a sling bag to access equipment without having to take off the packC. Theft resistantD. Room for a water bottle, umbrella, keys, and other personal items.I tried and considered several items including the Tenba Shootout Medium Sling Bag, Lowepro Slingshot 100/200 (300 is hard to find in stock locally), Lowepro Fastpack 200, Canon 200EG. Surprisingly, all of these bags are too small to handle a 500mm w/ body attached. I also have a military fabric messenger bag I used prior to the 150-500 (custom added padding, dividers) but that became obsolete with the new lens. All of these bags had great features and would have worked wonderfully - if you don't have a large 400mm+ lens w/ body attached.I effectively had to forget about the side loading sling bags - they can hold a larger lens by itself but not with the camera body.Read more",,283,0.15627319109461965,1,9,1,,-0.023490702019581255,-1

"Excellent! But be aware Verizon can SUCK. It took me 2 SIM cards, 2 new accounts, 2 new phone numbers, and 2 days and endless hours on the phone and in the store to get my pre-paid account set up - because their network and system was all messed up, and everyone gave me and their reps conflicting information and prices and no one knew what was going on. And Verizon charges the most of any company, and has the most restrictive plans ever - even for pre-pay. I really like the ease of my VirginMobile account and device - but VirginMobile was getting a bad signal in some places I traveled to (rural areas), so I was forced to get a backup Verizon account and device - which - when it was finally setup after a hellacious 2 days of stupid Verizon tech support and ignorant and mindless customer service, and my money was exhorted from me at 3x the price of VirginMobile, it worked like a charm.

"So far so good. I'll update this review if I experience any problems that other users are reporting (starting off at fast speeds, then slowing down, etc.). I think those issues mainly depend on your coverage, and you can sometimes help it by getting an external antenna and/or signal amplifier if you are in an area with poor coverage (see below).

"Excellent! But be aware Verizon can SUCK. It took me 2 SIM cards, 2 new accounts, 2 new phone numbers, and 2 days and endless hours on the phone and in the store to get my pre-paid account set up - because their network and system was all messed up, and everyone gave me and their reps conflicting information and prices and no one knew what was going on. And Verizon charges the most of any company, and has the most restrictive plans ever - even for pre-pay. I really like the ease of my VirginMobile account and device - but VirginMobile was getting a bad signal in some places I traveled to (rural areas), so I was forced to get a backup Verizon account and device - which - when it was finally setup after a hellacious 2 days of stupid Verizon tech support and ignorant and mindless customer service, and my money was exhorted from me at 3x the price of VirginMobile, it worked like a charm.

"Just bought my 2013 Ford F 150 Platinum. Was underwhelmed with the audio quality of the Sony system. As I did my research, I realized that you could buy new Ford replacement speakers for about $8 a piece. That told me all I needed to know that replacing with something else would make a difference. I paid $120 per pair and replaced the fronts and the rears. the installation went pretty smoothly...a little tricky, but not bad at all (thanks YouTube!).I had no idea that replacing would make THAT much difference. Completely night and day difference! Let's face it, speakers are pretty inexpensive. I can't say enough great things about these JBL speakers. They are crisp, warm, and totally rock!

"I ran this RAM at 2133 MHz because at the time I had a 6th gen Intel processor. I really did not have any issues with the product except for the fact that on several non Z series mobos (MSI, Gygabyte) it would only run in single channel mode and unfortunately did not have a Intel XMP profile (really not a big deal if you research stable OC voltages and don't get hung up on stuff you don't need). But none the less I was able to play any game I wanted with ease. 16 GB at 2133 really is more than most people need and chances are if you are just beginning to build your own PC this will be an extremely good upgrade. It runs very fast, stable and most of all cool. I am posting some pics below and this setup has never ran past 28 degrees even when I have increased voltages. A good tip for any new builder is to just spend the extra cash on a Z series mobo so you can really play with and learn what your RAM and CPU can do.

Used it for a while with my laptop on trips--worked fine--until Sling decided they would no longer support Vista. There was NO warning about this when I paid for it.

"I had high expectations for the srs-hg1 and this little guy didn't disappoint. It's touted as the world's smallest hi-res speaker, and I'll keep my praise focused on its ability to handle hi-res (in the case of this speaker: a ceiling of 24 bit by 96 kHz) audio files. I've listened to a number of albums recorded at lower quality (the standard 16/44 256k variety) through it, and the speaker still sounds excellent for its size, but the H.ear go really sings when paired with a hi-res capable source.One significant trick up Sony's kimono is the ability to sync with their proprietary LDAC Bluetooth codec. LDAC allows wireless transmission of up to 900 kbps, and it sounds noticeably superior to aptx or sbc Bluetooth standards. Of course, you need a device capable of pushing LDAC (such as the NWZ Walkman players, or Xperia Z5 and later Sony smart phones) and a hi-res audio file to hear the LDAC effect. I'm syncing with the NWZ-A17 silver and Xperia Z5 phone, and they both sound amazing when paired with this speaker. A further feature of the H.ear go is the ability to connect via micro USB to your PC, at which point the H.ear go bypasses the sound card of your computer, using its own DAC to play hi-res files. I've tried this as well, and the quality is impressive.Perhaps you are not into hi-res music and you don't own a bunch of Sony kit. Well, I still think you still will be very pleased with the H.ear go. It's a great sounding portable speaker with great battery life and connectivity options. 200 is a reasonable price for this unit. Personally, I'm angling to pick up a second one so I can experience the stereo sound and multi-room features that pairing two or more of these speakers will provide.Read more",5.0,308,0.31470663265306126,0,15,8,0.3426466836734694,-0.06855257428481665,-1

"I own the full previous Sony line of speakers for wireless streaming all over my house... SRS-HG1 (kitchen), SRS-X77 (office - it blends nicely), SRS-X88 (bedroom) & SRS-X99 (living room), and now, the SRS-ZR7 (foyer/entryway). These are GREAT speakers, excellent fidelity, and while they're not cheap by any means, you really get what you pay for. Heavy, high-quality builds and excellent sound, that are also classy looking and compliement your décor. Sony's ""Music"" app on iOS allows you to adjust all sorts of settings, and rename your speakers however you like, which affects how they show up on AirPlay lists and GoogleCast. (Note: The ZR7 is not AirPlay or AirPlay 2 compatible). It's not the best app, but it works for making all of the adjustments.

I have a Denon receiver and all Klipsch speakers for my home theater system, but I use these Sony speakers for wireless music throughout the house and I love it - excellent sound, also Hi-Res audio capable (except the X77). If you're looking for heavy bass, invest in a subwoofer - heavy bass mixed into a small-ish speaker = lackluster for sound. Overly heavy bass generally drowns out the high end and diminishes fidelity. The ZR7 (and the X88) have good bass though, and customizable EQs if you want to emphasize that end of the spectrum.

"If you can; go for another brand, here is why:1-It has a very weak bass, not what SONY claims at all. the case of the speaker itself is of such thin plastic that makes the speaker just shake instead of sending the bass into the room or space.2- if you want a multi room system out of these speakers, it becomes very expensive, much more than a dedicated system like SONOS, and is becomes complicated, needing to buy a WIFI router and trying to piece all the components together with SONY""s Songpal. I tried it and got frustrated with the App. 3- the SONGPAL App (now called Music), is clumsy and works sometimes, and sometimes it does not.

"It's hard to do a perfect review on a hard drive, because one of the most important things is how well they store your data over time. You can't magically peek into the future and see whether these things will or won't die or give you problems along the way, so I'll try to keep it down to what I do know.This 3TB Toshiba drive replaced a 2TB Seagate that started having I/O errors when reading a small bit of data. Not wanting to risk waiting to see if that small error would become a bigger problem, I ordered this drive and had it shipped to me, which was processed and delivered faster than expected. Props to Best Buy and UPS for that.As for the drive itself, it has a three year warranty, but being larger than 2TB you'll have to format it using GPT rather than the old MBR standard, otherwise you won't be getting the full amount of space on the drive. Formatting will take a few hours, so after installing the drive don't expect to have it raring to go immediately.Speaking of installing, this is a bare-bones, no frills hard drive despite being in a retail box -- inside the cardboard you'll find a lot of foam padding to keep the drive protected, the drive itself within a protective bag, and a little warranty paper, but NOTHING ELSE. No screws, no cables, no instructions. Since I had extra parts and was familiar with the installation process, this was not a problem for me, but this drive is not a great choice for novices who have never poked around a computer's insides before.All said and done though, this Toshiba drive is doing its job, and seems to be a little faster and snappier than the old one it replaced. I can't really complain, and it has chugged along pretty much 24/7 in the several days its been since I got it. I did install a separate heatsink/fan to the bottom of the unit as well, just to help make sure that it wouldn't overheat, especially in this sweltering summer heat. So far though, it's been smooth sailing.",5.0,359,0.08439542483660131,0,15,1,0.4578022875816994,-0.017972564291121818,-1
"If you want a small stereo receiver there are few other products out there. This one has good quality and small size. I found sound quality excellent and the design well thought out. The remote is simple and intuitive yet controls all functions including bass, treble, and balance. Settings are retained even with complete power off. I am very happy with this design. Two small caveats, though. Note that there is only one external line input and this is via an 1/8 inch (3.5mm) jack. This is the modern standard and will fit most digital audio outputs. RCA to 1/8 adaptors are readily available and will work with most legacy stereo outputs. My one small disappointment is that the USB port (for flashdrive input which works good) does not have power when any other input is selected. This means that one can't power an mp3 player while using the receiver. The user manual describes this and it can be downloaded from their website. IMHO, it would be nice to have the USB port on the front panel and have it available for flash drives and charging, but this might be cost prohibitive as tablets like nexii draw much more current than flashdrives. Other than this very minor issue I find this to be a perfect receiver. I have it connected to my computer audio output and it provides great sound while allowing easy switching over to radio or cd.Update: After using this receiver for six months, I like it more than ever. I have found the flashdrive feature more useful than I expected. Instead of burning a cd, just copy music files to any flashdrive and you're set to go faster, easier, and cheaper. The sound is great, balance and tone controls work well, and the remote is well designed ie intuitive, simple to operate yet fully functional, and white so it can be seen in dark room. My only gripe now is that this model only comes in black. I believe they have other versions that come in colors with speakers.

"I purchased this item a few weeks ago and have been loving it. The instructions that come with the unit aren't that great, but there are detailed downloadable instructions online. The unit is about 3 deep since it does not have a CD reader. This is fine for me because I bought it for the CarPlay, not for CD reading.The ILX-007 comes in a box with the harness with wiring that is more than long enough, a trim plate for what I'm assuming are custom jobs, a microphone and clip, and an auxiliary cable bundle for reverse cameras and what not.You will need to wire the parking brake wire to the actual parking brake or to a bypass or it will be stuck on demo mode. Another option would be to turn the car on to accessory mode and touch the parking brake wire to chassis of the ILX-007 while turning of demo mode in the settings. There are other settings that are grayed out without this wired up, but you will have access to all audio settings. I plan on wiring up a bypass later on when I install an amplifier in my car and end up pulling out the harness.As far as usage goes, it's pretty easy to use if you're familiar with apple products. I like the dedicated Sir button, although I wish there was a way to map a button on my steering wheel to the Siri button. I tried to do this with the PAC unit that I purchased, but couldn't get it to work.Overall I am very pleased with the clean aesthetics of this unit, the ease of installation (especially for my first head unit install), and the functionality.

"I replaced my Pioneer AppRadio 2 with the Alpine iLX-007. The AppRadio was the worst, full of bugs; new app releases were like rolling the dice.I was excited about CarPlay and I'm depending on Apple to handle software where Pioneer was inept. So the unit works great and is responsive. But there are two big problems:1# Spotify doesn't work 3/4 of the time. I asked Alpine Tech Support #much more responsive and nicer than Pioneer's# if they had a procedure to bring back Spotify to life, they did not. They said that this is an Apple problem and they must fix it.2) The CarPlay version of Apple Maps has two problems. First, you cannot use the touch screen to move or size the map like you do on the iPhone. Instead you have to bounce around with buttons for zooming and moving. Really stupid!Also traffic doesn't seem to work in CarPlay. Even on the iPhone, traffic is terrible and doesn't show as black, red, yellow or green like in all other map apps like Google Maps. Please Apple, its not that hard to know what people like! It would seem that the 34 Car Manufacturers listed on Apple's CarPlay site would expect stuff to be a lot better.

"I bought these speakers from Best Buy for 100. That was a mistake! I should've bought them from Amazon!I have these speakers hooked up to a kenwood amp putting the required RMS power to them, so the speakers frankly have everything they need to perform as good as they will. I am happy with them but I believe I could've probably bought better speakers for the same amount of money. The base is good, the mids are okay and the highs are okay. By no means do these speakers suck. They are far better than my stock '98 4Runner speakers.However every now and then on higher volumes you can hear the tweeters crack a little bit. Indeed, as so many reviewers before me have said, the crossovers supplied with the speakers really don't do a good enough job of keeping the lower mid-range frequencies away (keep in mind that my amp is set to keep all base frequencies away from these speakers, so if you don't have any type of crossover before your speakers this issue could even be worse!). This isn't a huge deal as at the volumes I'm talking about your ears are hurting, HOWEVER, what about when I want to open the doors and use my system to keep me company while doing some yard work or while camping I see myself using these speakers as I see fit regardless of how much damage I do to them. If they finally die on my due to my abuse I'll just replace them with a different brand - a brand that doesn't have these tweeter clipping problems.I am happy with my purchase but I'm not ecstatic - and as a consumer, don't we all want to feel like we have superior components that didn't stab our wallets as well Isn't that why most of us purchase good online in the first placeI recommend you go elsewhere for your needs. In my research many people seem to have great things to say about Rocksford Fosgate. In the past I have had great experiences with Boston Acoustics and Kenwood speakers.",,350,0.27604166666666674,3,12,1,,-0.06354988502494019,-1
"I have a 2001 Honda Insight... tiny tiny car. The stock sound system is probably the worst sound system ever installed in a factory car since the 70's. Seriously. So I've embarked on a budget sound-improvement odyssey and these speakers are the step which finally made it really work.My first step when I got the car was to replace the (paper!) door speakers with a pair of Pioneer Coaxials. Cheap but they dropped right in and helped a lot. But the sound was still definitely low-fi. So I replaced the radio with a Dual unit on sale from Best Buy. It got good reviews for sound quality and had lots of bells and whistles for the money. Noticeable improvement in the sound but still lacked something. I added an 8 Kicker L5 sub in a custom box with a 300 watt amp. Very nice improvement in the low-end but the sound was still lacking. Mostly the high's seemed both shrill and muddy at the same time. Tinny, harsh. It was kind of awful at high volumes, it made me cringe sometimes and I'm no audio snob. I just couldn't take it. Turning down the treble just made harsh music with no treble. I wondered if it was resonance from my doors making such a terrible sound. So I took the doors apart and put in sound-deadening material. It made no difference.Finally I went to Best Buy and tested all the speakers they had on display. These Alpine Components sounded the best to me mostly the highs just seemed smoother than all the others, and they were on sale for very cheap. Installation was a bit tricky, both because of the separate tweeter and because the speaker has a bigger magnet than stock. It also required use of the included adapter ring and a fair amount of minor cutting and dremelling of the speaker cups to get everything to fit.Read more",,320,0.1739206349206349,1,9,1,,-0.03238947697562833,-1
"For the price I was a bit weary about the sound quality, but I was soon amazed by the quality. Install was a bit of a pain because my last set of speakers were professionally installed and they had cut the metal in both doors despite the fact that I purchased mounts specific to my truck which they didn't use, damn best buy. The cross overs for their size actually work as they should, just make sure you do the 30-45min break-in period, i have them hooked to a sony gtx-130 head unit which the volume goes to 32, I drove around on the highway with the volume at 27, sounded like crap in the beginning. Wow was I amazed, the longer they played the better they got, I had it cranked for atleast an hour, after that they blew my 200 pioneer 6x9's out of the water. Bass was not distorted or scratchy, highs were crystal clear. I drive a fully restored 1994 s10 blazer, and plan on highly modifying the interior so I can buy two more sets of these, put one set in the kick panels and the second set in the plastic area of the trunk, also plan on purchasing the alpine 50watt X 4 amp and an alpine double din dvd/cd touch screen head unit with an alpine type R sub in the trunk...I'll never listen to music on my onkyo surround receiver again!",,239,0.14176470588235296,1,10,1,,-0.0035183710329086404,-1
"This computer has so many features that I wanted in a computer, at a reasonable price! My son offered to build me a computer with what I needed, but when I found this, at about the same price, and ready to go, I jumped at it! It has lots of USB 3 ports (8), one 3.1 port, and two 2.0 ports, so that I can plug in all my external drives that I store my pictures on, printers, mouse and keyboard, plus have extra ports!. Four of the ports are in front, which makes for easy access to changing what goes into those. I also like the 16G of memory which makes working with Photoshop and Lightroom go very fast, even if I have other programs open. The design is sleek and simple. I replaced the video card because I needed one that worked with all the Photoshop functions, and it was very easy to open the box, use the swing out power supply to access the card and replace it. So far I am very happy and impressed with this Dell XPS.",5.0,183,0.2582291666666667,3,14,3,0.37088541666666663,-0.027114005864115054,-1
"This is my third XPS computer in 15 years. The first was powerful but had very noisy fans, my wife who shared my office said it sounded like a plane warming up for takeoff. The second XPS was quiet, but this third iteration seems to be edging back up in noise level though not anywhere near as annoying or loud as the first.I use the XPS computer for two main tasks: Photo editing in Lightroom and Photoshop. Managing online marketing using platforms like AdWords and Analytics. This model is easily up to the task in either case. Web platforms load quickly and photos transfer between programs at an acceptable speed.I would recommend 32 GB of memory as an upgrade, and the AMD Radeon RX560 video card is about the minimum usable for the Adobe products. Photoshop working on layered files needs lots of RAM, and Lightroom is heavily dependent on video GPU / video memory for processing speed. While the RX560 meets or exceeds Adobe's suggested video memory requirements, the card seems to under perform compared to the NVIDIA card I added to the previous computer.I would recommend the XPS series for nearly anyone, but I suggest that the off the shelf models can be improved with more memory and better video cards over time. If I had one wish it would be that Dell pick a RAM memory type and stick with it. I've purchased memory upgrades for my two previous XPS computers, and none of the previous sticks will fit into the next model computer. I know, memory technology improves over time too, but it's still aggravating to have 64GB of unusable memory sticks just laying around while this new computer is starved for more GB's.",4.0,288,0.10078787878787879,0,18,11,0.2496060606060606,-0.07299776353907816,-1
"I was very excited to have the opportunity to get this computer, as my main desktop is 7 years old, and showing its age. I had just decided that I finally needed a replacement. This computer is a very wonderful and welcome upgrade. The tower is designed to be smaller than the standard desktop size, which makes it easier to find a place for it. I like the silver styling on the front panel very much. This computer has a tool-less design, which means that you can access the internal components without having to use any additional tools. I always wanted that feature in my next computer, because trying access the internal components on my old one was always a pain. This computer has about 11 USB ports, which is another plus because I have a ton of USB peripherals. In addition, most of the ports on the computer are the Super Speed USB 3.0 ports, which mean that I can use faster flash drives and peripherals. They even threw in a USB-C port, although it is only one.There are audio ports on both the front and the back, and this computer comes with WaveMaxx audio support, which makes external speakers sound wonderful. There is a single DVD-RW drive, so you can read and write CDs and DVDs. There is an SD card reader on the front as well. The fan system on this computer is excellent. I have not had anything happen that caused me to notice the fans kicking in in high gear.The other hardware features this computer has is a whopping 16GB of RAM, a 1 TB 7200 RPM hard drive, Bluetooth 4.0 and Wireless AC, both Intel HD Graphics 630 and an AMD Radeon RX 560 with 2GB of dedicated DDR5 RAM, and the lovely seventh generation Intel Core i7-7700 processor at 3.60 Ghz. The processor shows up as eight processors in the Device Manager, so this is one powerful computer.The modest games that I have run (osu!, DC Universe Online, Team Fortress, Minecraft) all ran without a breeze. The only issue that I had was due to me not using the correct graphics card. This computer has both integrated and dedicated graphics, and the HDMI connection that is the most obvious one is the integrated one, so I accidentally connected my monitor to the integrated graphics card by mistake. The integrated graphics port should have been covered on my unit, but it was not. So when I started gaming and had some display issues, I was surprised until I checked the manual online and realized my mistake. Still, the integrated card did run the games admirably, but nowhere near as well as the Radeon card.The computer comes with a decent keyboard and mouse. The keyboard has media shortcuts and is in a chiclet style, and the mouse actually has a built-in DPI switcher. Both are wired. The computer ships with Windows 10 Home.This computer has been a blast to use for the past few days. I have not gotten around to use all of the features, but what I have tried so far has been amazing. Also the warranty that comes with it is great. Onsite service after remote diagnosis. The service and support for the XPS line has always been great from Dell. I would definitely recommend this computer to someone who wants to be able to have a powerful machine with great features and gaming ability at a decent price.",5.0,577,0.21730476190476192,1,38,1,0.39134761904761906,-0.141225491299116,-1
"I have been researching Over the Ear bluetooth headphones for some time. I work in an IT environment, if I'm not on conference calls then I'm listening to music to drown out surrounding noise while I work all day at a computer. Since I have to go back and forth from call to music I typically use the ear buds that came with my phone, that have a mic.I may be the only one, but earbuds get sooo uncomfortable after hours of use. I tried a Jawbone for about a day, can't do the bluetooth in ear either..Over the ear BT headphones prices vary so much and can get very expensive on top of that I don't know that I would like them.. I bought these because they were cheap as a test run... After about 4 hours at work I LOVE them. They drown out a majority of outside noise without completely blocking all sound. (Which is good if someone is calling your attention) Music sounds WAY better than I would have imagined for the price. Of course BT headphones in general have a way to go.. these are great. So far so good on conference calls, other callers can't even tell I'm on a headset!! That's better than my earbud mic!!!If you are hesitant to buy a bluetooth over the ear headphone set, start with this one. I will likely upgrade to higher quality set eventually.... but for now I'm 100% satisfied. They are comfortable to wear all day long! Also not to mention NO WIRES!The only slight flaw is they are smaller than your typical skull candy hesh or beats over the ear set. They fit my head/ears perfectly, but if you can you should look at them in the store or google pictures of them on someone - to make sure you like the way they look.",5.0,311,0.20859375,7,18,1,0.39570312500000004,-0.10190656656568953,-1
"First, i want you all to know that i am a techno-junkie. I will try as many items as possible to know that i own the best. A couple of months back, i was in the market for bluetooth headphones to pair with my iPhone, as i travel quite a bit. Admittedly, since they are not of the in-ear variety, i had concerns that they wouldn't work well on an airplane, where it is extremely noisy. Also, keep in mind, that i tried a handful of other bluetooth headphones before settling on the AF32's. To name a few, i've tried the Jaybirds, Motorola's and Wireless Rhythm by Mikey's. Also, tried a few others. To begin with, for on-ear headphones, i couldn't believe how the cabin noise from a plane had no effect on the sound/music i was listening to. For example, even the voices in movies i was watching, was very easy to hear. Now for the shocker. The bass that came from the AF32's was shocking. It wasn't boomy at all. What i heard, was crisp bass that sounded on par with some of my go-to over the ear headphones. Pairing the headphones to my iPhone couldn't have been easier. Better yet, it charges quickly via USB and holds a charge for quite a long time. I don't know how long it's rated, but i got 7 hours on my last trip with juice to spare! If i could make just one comment that i'd like improved on future models, concerns the built-in microphone. In quiet areas, the person on the other end of the phone had no idea i was wearing headphones. With lots of noise in the background, the person i was talking to commented that they were hearing quite a bit of noise. Honestly though, i bought these for their ability with music. When i'm in a noisy environment, i simply switch back to using the iPhone's microphone. Let me tell you that it's a very small price to pay for the ability to listen to my music wirelessly, where the music sounds 100x better than i could have ever hoped. Allow me to save you time. If you are in the market for the best sounding bluetooth headphones, look no further. Don't be fooled by the reasonable price. They are truly that good! I don't know how Meelectronics did it! I will now be buying a few other AF32's as gifts for friends and colleagues. If i can leave you off with one final word, it would be ""Wow!"" Please keep in mind that i have no affiliation with the company or company representatives. Also, it is very rare that i take the time to write a review of products that i own. However, after spending some time with these, i couldn't help myself.",5.0,469,0.13846491228070174,4,6,1,0.4307675438596491,-0.08558098630660116,-1
"I purchased this several months ago with the intention of replacing another really worn-out set. I never would of guessed how much it has become integrated into my routine. As a student, I carry many books on occasion (as would be expected of one). When I use earbuds or wired headphones, they would only get in the way, and when I wanted to make a call/take a call, cables + wires would only get in my way.When I got the MEElectronics Air-fi, ALL of my problems were gone. I could carry all my books (in-hand and in-bag) without any hassle if I wanted to listen to music/make a call. Granted, I still haven't explored all the possible functions these headphones offer, they serve me very well. The microphone is more receptive than I thought - I would imagine I would need to speak up in a crowded place but that was never the case, the caller could perfectly hear as if I were speaking through the phone's microphone. The Bluetooth is also very good - 10 ft. of bluetooth was not exaggerated!The only problem I really had with these is that if you wear them too long, they heat up your ears. It's great for winter, when it's uber cold, but during the summer...you can imagine what issues can crop up.All-in-all, excellent headphones, great utility, great price.",5.0,227,0.31799999999999995,1,15,1,0.34099999999999997,-0.010870376163957585,-1
"The MEElectronic AirFi Bluetooth headphones are a product I would buy again and again. To start, you simply cannot beat the price of these headphones for the quality they provide. Second, the sound quality is excellent. I am a music junky and I have gone through dozens of headphones, but the sound quality on this pair would one of the best I've come across so far. Mind you, I never spend more than $100 for a pair of headphones. I also love that these headphones feature a built in mic, control keys, and the option to use the provided 3.5mm stereo cable to connect to any headphone compatible device. Amazing! I also, love the colors and glossy plastic, but that's purely a cosmetic thing. They seem pretty durable too, but I wouldn't go making a habit out of slamming them onto the floor.Now, the padding of the headphones makes for a pretty comfortable wearing experience, but they sometimes like to slide off my head when I look down or just headbanging to the beat. Also, I have noticed that the headphones become out of sync at times (usually I only notice this while watching Hulu or Netflix on my PC), but turning the headphones off and back on resolves this problem. Another very minor issue with these headphones is the lack of an ""L"" and/or ""R"" stamped on the either side of the headphones to indicate the proper placement of the speakers over your ears. Though I figured that the built in mic should point forward, which would mean the side with the buttons should be placed over your right ear.All-in-all I am extremely happy with these headphones and would highly recommend them to anyone looking to buy a set of Bluetooth headphones that fit a smaller budget.",5.0,298,0.2779594017094017,1,15,1,0.3610202991452991,-0.02186108497097916,-1
"Initially bought these for gaming so that I could chat with friends (on Ventrillo) and not have that cable drooping over my arms. Didn't work out. But the more I researched I found that it wasn't the headphones fault, it was Bluetooth in general. Bluetooth won't process a microphone in mono and stereo audio at the same time. The result is using your device in pure mono. Not so great. Again, not the headsets fault. So with this in mind, I don't game with the device using Bluetooth, I use my other wired gaming headset.All that aside, I love this headset. It was only $59, and I use it daily. I use it for my Galaxy Note 8, PC, Motorola Droid Razr Maxx when I'm not home, and at the gym.The fit is just right for my head, and I like how it's very light. I don't feel like I have a giant headset on that can come flying off If I move my head to quickly.The sound is superb, I was extremely surprised how good the bass was. I typically listen to Hip Hop and House music, so that was key for me. I bought these online, so I was worried they would not meet my needs. But they did.The Bluetooth connection is decent. Although, my other headsets have not been any better. I imagine this is probably related to the fact that my entire house is wireless. My wife and two kids use tablets daily, their gaming consoles are wireless, in addition to their laptops and my wifes PC. That combined with our wireless Smart TV's, and wireless stereos in the bathrooms... we have alot of RF floating around in the house. I'll cut this a break. I can typically walk about 30' away before it starts to break up. Although, I think this is the maximum that the FCC will allow, so no heartache there.The device pairs quite easily, and I use it on several devices, so I don't have any complaints in this department.Battery life is actually really good. I can go 3 days or so using it for about 4 hours a day. I don't let them sit on the charger when not in use, because that is probably bad for any device. When I go to charge them, the connect is bad, so I have to let the headphones sit at an angle on top of the connector so that it gets a good connection and charges. I'm sure it's the cable and not the headset, as the headset comes with a wired cable so that you can use this headset in wired mode.Using the headset in wired mode is a really nice feature, as if I'm low on charge I don't have to seek out a new headset.The headset also folds up for easy storing, and they provide a nice little felt bag in case you need to pack these up for traveling. Nice touch if you ask me.That's my review, hope this helps somebody out.I highly recommend these if you're looking for a headset that is cheap and really meets these primary needs:Great SoundEasy to Pair to multiple devicesLong life and charges using a USB plugFolds up for easy packingComfortable fit",5.0,539,0.1948392959242016,0,31,1,0.4025803520378992,-0.11554158236527656,-1
"After great experiences with other MEE Audio products, I bought my son (11 years old) the Runaway bluetooth headphones to replace his Koss headphones that only lasted a few months (internal solder joints broke). I've never even owned a pair of bluetooth headphones myself, so I figured that I could get some use out of these too (which I have). ;) My thought was that wireless would be the best way to avoid any audio problems related to wiring, which I speculate is the failure point of the majority of earbuds and headphones.The Runaways have not disappointed in the slightest, and I could not be more pleased. They simply sound GREAT. Construction is study plastic, and the wear is comfortable, adjustable, with easy-to-control bluetooth functions. The headphones collapse for storage, within a nice included felt bag. An included stout 3.5mm cable can be used if desired, perhaps when the battery is running low for bluetooth function.I am not an audiophile, but I'm a music lover and have spent several years as a stage musician at a church with 7,000 - 9,000 congregants... so I have a decent amount of experience and appreciation for musical detail and great audio.If you want to dabble in the bluetooth headphone market for a great product that won't break the bank... these Runaways are for you!",5.0,221,0.2826086956521739,1,9,5,0.3586956521739131,-0.016466575032588415,-1

Since then, I have used them in all kinds of situations and find that they work excellently everywhere, without skipping. I have used them on long walks, on my commute through NYC's subway system, and at home. Mostly pros in the headphone. The only con (and this is true of all wireless headphones) is that the bass is not as deep or booming as on a wired headphone.Pros - instant connection with my various Bluetooth devices good battery life no skipping while walking or in the gym clear music streaming great comfort and fit good sound isolation - not active noise cancelation, but this sound isolation enables one to listen to music or talks at volumes that are not too high even in a NYC subway while listening to music, even people standing next to you cannot overhear it (which is a HUGE thing for me, as I detest having to listen to other people's screeching music while commuting) controls for volume, skipping tracks and pairing on the headphones are easy to use and logically placed.I would have liked the ability to turn my iPod or iPad on or off from the headset itself, but maybe that is not technologically feasible, I don't know.Highly recommend these headphones for purchase.",,272,0.23513492063492067,0,12,1,,-0.008973151641529897,-1

"I'm very happy with this purchase.Background, I use these on my daily commute. 40 minute walk through the hills of San Francisco. Windy, check. Wanted for both listening to music/podcasts as well as making phone calls. Primarily using with an android phone.I was worried about a couple things when I bought these: - Read peoples ears got sweaty - Had some mixed reviews for phone calls - Some said they didn't stay on head extremely wellPassed those, I had read all positives on these for the price-point. And in my opinion, none of these were an issue for me. They stay on my head just fine. I've even jogged with them and they maintained their position. Ears get a little sweaty on really sunny days. If you live in a hot climate, have the sun pounding on you while using -- you may want to consider that. For me here in SF, not an issue at all. Even on sunny days, with a cool breeze, no issue whatsoever. Phone calls have been wonderful as well. Was on a busy street earlier, they could still hear me loud and clear. So much so that I was happily surprised. I thought for sure with the wind ripping past, people honking etc, there's no way this is going to be a good experience. I was so wrong.First impressions:- They were a little smaller/thinner than I was expecting. Not sure why, they look jsut as they do in the image. But to my delight, still fit me beautifully.- Because it's all plastic, it doesn't look quite as cool as the new monster phones, but then again they are not 300 and they are sooo light because of it. I could literally wear these all day without really noticing.- Actually, they look pretty cool.- Bluetooth is painless, easily connected to pc and phone.- The sound quality is great.Read more",,314,0.2520779220779221,0,9,1,,-0.0035552152067622744,-1

Needless to say, I'm glad I didn't dish out the cashola for the Dre Beats ones.Another advantage this set has is that you can use it wirelessly or with a wire (which is included).I give this device a 4 out of 5 because the flaws are that it can make your ears sweat a little bit and that the charging cord is unique in that you have to plug the cord into your earphone jack of the headphones, thus preventing you from using them while they charge.Hope this helps. But for now, this is the least expensive to quality sound reproduction headset ratio you are going to find on the market.",,316,0.22185000000000002,1,12,1,,-0.036812822868713235,-1

"Having just bought a new 55"" QLED Samsung a few weeks ago for myself & now it was time to hand some cool HD vision to my Bro, who needed an update after a (cool then..) 27"" Toshiba CRT! I'm VERY familiar with all the Samsung products, & had no hesitation of what I wanted to buy, but more a simple decision on the size...my Bro had no need for 4K, but we did compare the HD vision of the Samsung products to the 32-36"" variants, & decided on the 40"" HD...PIC is RAZOR, & the SMART addition to the HD was something the Bro had no idea about, & yet, has been tickled pink since he received his HD!

"This is my first time purchasing a Samsung television, and I am extremely pleased with it! It is a perfect television for watching sporting events and entertaining company. If you are looking for a smart television for a low price and great quality I definitely recommend this Samsung 50-inch LED SmartTv.When receiving this product the shipping was fast and was packaged well. The set-up was a simple and quick process. It took me about ten minutes to get it all set up. The accessibility of this television is one of its best qualities. It easily connects to Wi-Fi for the use of Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, and searching the web. It is also equipped with two HDMI outlets, which are very convenient. I found the smart television features to be quite easy to navigate.It has come in extremely useful when having company over for parties, because it is great for watching and listening to music videos. The sound quality of the speakers is excellent. No need for expensive portable speakers we just listen to it off the television! The LED lighting makes the brightness and color fantastic for a great overall picture quality. The clear picture is wonderful for watching football games and hosting movie nights.I believe the price is great for the value that you receive. Compared to most smart televisions this Samsung has excellent quality and is quite affordable. I would suggest this television for college students like myself who are looking for a nice television for a relatively low price. It is a perfect television for my roommates and me, and I can still afford my Ramen noodles.The only negative comment I would have about this purchase is the television stand. It has a two-leg base, so it does not seem as sturdy as what is shown in the advertisement. I saw this to only be a minor inconvenience that would not deter me from recommending this product. I would suggest using a wall mounting instead. With this being my first experience with Samsung, I will definitely be using their products in the future. I think this is a perfect television for young adults on a budget. The accessibility, quality, and price won this television a five star rating from me. Overall this was a great purchase, and I would highly recommend this product. It made a great addition to my living room!",5.0,395,0.3427678571428571,3,14,1,0.3286160714285714,-0.08077892948017062,-1

"I'm so disappointed in this Samsung TV. I just got it today and set it up only to find out the Smart Hub where all the apps are accessed does not work. I called Samsung customer service about the issue and I was told by a representative that this particular model is faulty where users try to access the Smart Hub and nothing happens. The rep then proceeded to tell me that it is a known issue and their engineers are working on fixing it. So I asked how long the issue was known and the rep said for a week. He told me I can either return the TV to Amazon for a refund or wait until the engineers come up with a solution. So I asked him, why Amazon did not pull this particular model from their inventory and he said he could not comment on that. So I have concluded that either Amazon knew about the issue and still sold the product as advertised even though the smart features are missing (this is considered false advertising and illegal) or they didn't know and the fault lies with Samsung soley. On top of all of that The rep could not give me a time frame for when the issue would be fixed and there is a real possibility it can't be fixed. So now I have this basic tv that does none of the things I purchased it for. Lets just say I'm livid. Please people, save yourself the time, money, and frustration and do not buy this model!!",1.0,261,-0.0014880952380952484,2,11,1,0.2992559523809524,-0.008668398597757032,-1

"It took me weeks of research before I purchased this product. I liked the idea of the Yamaha name, but was concerned the quality would be less than optimal because the price was so low. While I am not an audiophile I like to have the best my limited money can buy. The 6 Ohm rating was a big hiccup for me as well, as 8 ohm is what all receiver ratings are calculated on. But after looking closely at the manual for my receiver I found it supported 6-16 Ohm speakers. So we were good there. My receiver, a Pioneer VSK-519 showed up before my speakers so I hooked it up to some Sony book shelf speakers to test it out. When the Yamaha speakers came I was only able to hook up three of the five speakers with the included speaker wire, so I used the Sony's as R and L. The Sony's put out noticeably more sound than the Yamaha's which was at first concerning to me. And once I got them out of the way I had to turn the receiver up higher to get the same output. I watch movies right around 50-52 when with the Sony speakers, I was quite happy at 40. I suspect this is related to the 82 db rating (and the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5). But turning the Amp up a little higher is not a big deal and the Receiver has been very happy in it's low ventilation area, and is in no danger of overheating.I also upgraded my speaker wire to 16 gauge and have not noticed a difference.Other thoughts, even though the Sub is a 100W amp, it only produces 50W of output, just like it says on the Manufacture site. So Amazon was a little misleading there.

"Using this with a Sony BD player and Onkyo 5.1 amp linked via coax audio TV via HDMI. After all settings were completed, the action and big explosions sounded great.

"Using this with a Sony BD player and Onkyo 5.1 amp linked via coax audio TV via HDMI. After all settings were completed, the action and big explosions sounded great. If you listen to movies using TV speakers, you don't know what you're missing.br /br /BUT I couldn't hear dialog. Checked all settings, and searched online forums. I tried to boost the dB for the center but still couldn't hear. Speakers are connected via Monster Cable instead of the flimsy speaker cable provided (so small the connectors won't even hold it). Then I used the test tone from the amp to find out the center channel speaker doesn't work. I'm using an existing bookshelf speaker for center for now.br /br /Otherwise, the bases sound fine and rest of the speakers seem more than powerful enough for my tiny home theater room.

"It took me weeks of research before I purchased this product. I liked the idea of the Yamaha name, but was concerned the quality would be less than optimal because the price was so low. While I am not an audiophile I like to have the best my limited money can buy. The 6 Ohm rating was a big hiccup for me as well, as 8 ohm is what all receiver ratings are calculated on. But after looking closely at the manual for my receiver I found it supported 6-16 Ohm speakers. So we were good there. My receiver, a Pioneer VSK-519 showed up before my speakers so I hooked it up to some Sony book shelf speakers to test it out. When the Yamaha speakers came I was only able to hook up three of the five speakers with the included speaker wire, so I used the Sony's as R and L. The Sony's put out noticeably more sound than the Yamaha's which was at first concerning to me. And once I got them out of the way I had to turn the receiver up higher to get the same output. I watch movies right around 50-52 when with the Sony speakers, I was quite happy at 40. I suspect this is related to the 82 db rating (and the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5). But turning the Amp up a little higher is not a big deal and the Receiver has been very happy in it's low ventilation area, and is in no danger of overheating.br /br /I also upgraded my speaker wire to 16 gauge and have not noticed a difference.br /br /Other thoughts, even though the Sub is a 100W amp, it only produces 50W of output, just like it says on the Manufacture site.

Confirmed with a voltage meter that it is getting a constant 12 volts but it you connect to blur tooth or plug in another device to the boat it causes the radio to fail.

"I bought this unit for my 2006 HD Road Glide as the original HD unit was hard to hear and the display went dark so could not see what adjustments I was making. After 3 days of working in some of the muggiest weather and going back and forth 20 miles one way to get tools clips and other crap as I have never installed a stereo on a bike before or stripped my bike down quite as far as this but wanted to make sure everything was as professional looking as possible. Also was really looking forward to thumb controlled Bluetooth music rather than aux plugin with no easy way to select music. So I get all finished up today and the plunkin faceplate does not catch (stuck on ejection of the faceplate). I did get it to finally catch and I really loved the sound and the bluetooth hookup made me a little giddy. Took it out for a spin and almost lost the faceplate on the very first bump. This unit arrived this way and I do not know if the problem is in the faceplate or the receiver as nothing looks broken off. This sucks as the whole grand total came out to 400.00 for the stereo, thumb control retainer and installation conversion kit (Dash and wire harness).

"UPDATE ... Bottom Line Up Front: DON'T BUY SONY MARINE PRODUCTS. Corrosion formed over two weeks on a brand new unit ... enough corrosion to void the manufactures warranty. I can only assume that the advertising on the anti-corrosion coating is EXTREMELY exaggerated or that this is a manufacturing defect (my contention with them). After this experience, I will not even CONSIDER a Sony marine ANYTHING. It is NOT manufactured correctly to handle use on water.This radio was a disappointment for a very specific reason: It failed within a month of first usage. Even worse, the warranty REPLACEMENT unit failed less than a month after installing it. The first unit's failure was the inability to leave demo mode, i.e. making it useless. The second unit's failure was more spectacular ... a blown fuse on the water leaving a nice toxic smoke behind the control panel. This was followed by the blowing of a replacement fuse back on shore when power was reapplied. Obviously, something in the unit has a major short -- the second fuse blew immediately, produced some arcing, and a nice puff of toxic smoke!Kudos to Sony on the first replacement process. No so good on this second replacement. At least it's under warranty (and I bought an Amazon extended warranty, too).When it worked, the sound was good with plenty of volume without distortion. Bluetooth with an iPhone worked fine but it was slightly cumbersome getting them paired. It was easy to read in the bright sunlight and fairly easy to operate. Tuning FM could be a challenge but once I got it going, it wasn't that difficult.If I were to do this over, I would NOT buy this radio. Instead, I would spend the additional money on a Sonichub 2 to work with my Lowrance unit and put a plate over the hole in my boat's dash.",1.0,310,0.06393325143325143,1,20,1,0.33196662571662566,-0.040712023294840805,-1

"I was excited to open the Sony SRS XB30, as my previous bluetooth speaker was relatively cheap, and left a lot to be desired, sound-wise.So, opening up the box, which in itself is nice and tactile, you are greeted straight away by the speaker. No messing around. Pulled it out and powered it up. The indicator in the SongPal app (I'll get to that later) showed 50% charge, so that was great, meant I could use it right out of the box. Sync'd it to my phone (without instructions) by pressing the big bluetooth button and then looking for it on my phone (just like you would with any other bluetooth device). Paired up really quickly. Chose my first song to play through it and away I went. Bam! The little speaker had a nice punch, straight out of the gate! I was very impressed, almost taken aback as I checked it out. Turned the volume up and it sounded great. Then, as anyone would, you HAVE to press the EXTRA BASS button. When you do, dual passive radiators work together with stereo full-range speakers to enhance the low-end tones, giving bass a nice boost  despite the speakers compact size. Basically, it sounds fantastic! However, I found that the speaker sounds fantastic, at a lower volume and when you are close to it. As I stepped away from the speaker and turned up the volume, the bass intensity dropped and more higher end sounds took precedence. I live in a moderately sized home with 25ft ceilings in the living room and the speaker was able to fill the room with sound, but didn't sound quite as bass-backed as it did when the volume was lower and I was closer to it. However, I am still very impressed with what this speaker can do, considering it's size. On to the SongPal app... I opened it up and got the speaker hooked up to it, and from there you can change many settings on the speaker. It has an illuminated LED ring around it and two strobe lights. You can turn them on and off and you can control certain colors of the ring with predetermined color pattens within the app. But you cannot directly choose the color with a color wheel. You can also check battery status, power settings, adjust the EXTRA BASS and more. The unit claims a 24 hour battery life (when not using the lights on it) and so far, it's living up to it's claims. You can connect via bluetooth as mentioned or also via USB.You can also link speakers, so if you have more than one of them, you can link them for stereo sounds. And if you want more, you can link up to 10 of them together for a full on party atmosphere! The speaker is also water-resistant, not completely waterproof. So don't drop it in the pool and expect it to work, but it is splash proof and spill proof, so you can take it and use it at the beach as long as you make sure that the internal components cover is securely fastened, as Sony mentions many times in the instruction manual!You can connect up to three devices to it as well, although I haven't tried this feature as I would only use it with my phone. I would love to see a power indicator on my phone as to how much power is left in the speaker. I use a pair of Sony Bluetooth Headphones (MDR-XB70BT) every day and they provide a little icon showing how much charge is left in them on my phone. That would be useful with the speaker, as I may not always use the SongPal app when using the speaker. As for the SongPal app, I had an issue with the speaker connecting twice to it, and then not registering either of them. I had to erase the speakers and reconnect them. Not a deal breaker but it made the SongPal app feel a little clunky. It would be nice to have a color wheel to choose individual colors for the LED ring around the speaker, but again, not a deal breaker, but a nice to have feature. Overall I am very impressed with the Sony SRS XB30 Bluetooth Speaker and I would recommend it to my friends without hesitation.",4.0,725,0.24523892773892766,5,32,2,0.17738053613053617,-0.17458326381196276,-1
"This is the third Bluetooth speaker we have in the house which enables me to make a direct comparison to two competitors from different manufacturers. However the other two have price points higher than this Sony XB30 with a $149.99 MSRP (one is $50 higher and the other is $100 higher).The Sony comes in multiple colors and the outside of the case has a rubberized finish with metal grilles front and rear (the back one is for a passive radiator). The unit has a nice substantial feel to it and that combined with the feel of the controls gives the sensation of a quality made piece. The front grille is surrounded by a light bar that has a number of different preprogrammed colors and patterns along with a couple of white strobes, none of which appear to keep time or rhythm to the music being played. The light show variations cannot be accessed directly from the speakers built-in controls, you have to make changes from the SongPal app (which is free), but you can toggle the current light selection on or off using a button on the speaker. The jacks for power, audio in, and USB connection (to charge your phone from the speaker) are on the back of the speaker under a cover that has a water resistant gasket as the speaker is IPX5 rated for water resistance. Note that if the cover is open for a connection its water resistance is compromised.The Extra Bass function provides a nice bass boost that once you become accustomed to it, leaves the speaker sounding kind of tinny or thin when it is turned off. I did find the speaker to be lacking in treble both when playing files from iTunes via my iPhone 6 and when connected with a cable to an iPod Classic playing Apple Lossless files. The SongPal app has a rudimentary three-band graphic equalizer enabling you to adjust bass, midrange and treble from flat to +10 or -10 with three sliders. The bass and mid had a noticeable effect on the content I listened to, but the treble control had virtually no effect that I could tell.Two features I was not able to try out were the Wireless Party Chain since I have only one Sony speaker and the LDAC audio technology which is a higher quality Bluetooth connection which appears to be a proprietary Sony technology available on their ZX2 High-Resolution Audio Walkman and Xperia smartphones.I realize I am probably not in the target audience for this particular product due to my age, but I am a little confused by the combination of the multicolored line light and flashing strobe that would have probably appealed to the 12-year-old me along with the LDAC technology that comes in a $1200 hi-res music player that the 60-year-old me could afford but has difficulty rationalizing. I would expect someone with a high-resolution, audiophile-quality music player to be shopping wireless speakers at a much higher price point than this.The XB30 has a built-in microphone which enables you to have phone conversations using the device as a speaker/mic. Sound quality was far superior to the iPhones speaker phone function for both ends of the conversation (to be expected given the size difference of the speakers between the two devices). This feature helps the XB30 earn a place on your work desk.I think the XB-30 represents a good value for its price point given the additional technology and features it possesses when compared to the two other Bluetooth speakers I am familiar with, however the lack of treble response is a little disappointing, at least to me. Sound quality can be a rather subjective matter, and to be fair I was not able to judge its sound with it being driven by a LDAC capable device. There are many other players at this price level, so I suggest comparing at a retailer where you can listen to multiple speaker choices before making a decision.",4.0,661,0.10300546448087436,0,22,3,0.24849726775956282,-0.10166735231178559,-1
"After a few minutes playing with SONY's new XB30, I knew I was in trouble. Too many nieces and nephews who would feel left out if I gifted any one of them and not any of the others with this truly fun music box. Great sound, immense power handling, colorful, bright, and wickedly cool. Took mere seconds to get my laptop connected to the SONY XB30. Hit play and Adam Levine was sounding big, bold and great filling my large family room on this rather pint-sized sound box. Disconnected it from my laptop, and pulled out my iPhone 6. Within minutes I was playing Feist with perfect sound quality. My iPhone offered to download a Sony App to further control the XB30, but it was not necessary. It does let me adjust the volume from the App so I don't need to go up to the Sony XB30, but so what.The SONY XB30 has a few special tricks. A double click of the play button skips you forward. A 3 click pattern jumps you backwards in the song. It will apparently tie together with multiple SONY devices of this special EXTRA BASS SERIES so the kids can have a really loud party. Yikes. Oh . . . and it's a L-I-G-H-T S-H-O-W. Yeah, it lights up like an 80s disco. Shrink that massive boom box from the 70s/80s into a milk carton size (quart!), double the volume, add a light show and it connects with whatever music library you have on your phone. Not bad. Not bad at all. I'm gonna need to get a few more of these.SUMMARY: If there is something I could bring back from a visit to the 1980s, it might be the totally frivolous spirit of musical fun embodied by boom boxes. Boom boxes, for the too-young-to-know, were portable, but powerfully loud, all-in-one stereos that could entertain your moving party. Sony brings back all of the fun and eliminates the unnecessary. The ubiquitous smart phone has all the music you could ever carry, and bluetooth links to Sonys powerful speaker. Add to the mix a light show using LEDs creating little burden on your portable power, youre ready to go.",5.0,365,0.18443498325573798,1,21,2,0.40778250837213104,-0.0638768633071286,-1
"Despite its best efforts to scare me off, I actually do like this speaker a lot. Unboxing the speaker two things immediately struck me. First, the speaker is smaller than I'd thought it would be based on the box (lots of packing materials to keep it safe). Second, the speaker feels surprisingly heavy given its size. It only weighs a little more than 2 pounds according to my kitchen scale, but it feels a lot heavier than that when you're holding it in your hand. I got the speaker in blue (one of my favorite colors). The blue is a duskier shade than I was expecting, but it's still pleasing to the eye. That being said, I do regret not having picked this up in black as it would have coordinated with my furniture better. The texture is lightly rubberized and purports to be water resistant. The front of the speaker bears an LED light ring that can be customized to hit a range of different colors. All of the speaker's ports are hidden behind a door on the back right-hand side. It came with a great big notice taped to it advising you to make sure that the door is shut when the unit is in use. I can only presume that this is to ensure the unit's water resistance as it seems to operate perfectly fine with the door wide open. A surprising addition to the ports is a traditional USB type A port. It should be noted that this port is for power output only and does not support power input or data transfer. The documentation says that the port is included to charge one's phone or tablet using the speaker. This is a nice addition, but it feels a little random to me. Turning it on proved to be the first stumbling block for this review. Following the instructions, I charged the device for four hours prior to attempting to use it. With the speaker still plugged into the wall, I pressed the power button . . . and nothing happened. I tried pressing it several times and got no response whatsoever. I worried that I might have received a defective unit, but unplugging the device from the wall and pressing the power button finally yielded results with the device promptly turning on. Oddly, this was the only time that I encountered this issue. I have since left it plugged in and pressed the power button, and it turns on right away. Charging proved to be another oddity with this device. Using it for about two hours, I was down to 75% battery according to the phone app that goes with this speaker. With the speaker still on, I plugged it in to see about charging it while using it. An hour later, the app still reported a battery status of 75%. I'm not sure whether this is a characteristic of the device itself or a glitch with the phone app. Pairing the device was simple enough on an android phone. I did have to turn my Bluetooth on and off to get it to show up, but I suspect that was the result of a bug on my phone and not with this speaker. The app that works with this speaker is a little too generic and lacks polish. This is where things start to go downhill. First, the big selling point for this speaker is its ability to wirelessly pair up and synchronize with other speakers from this series to create a stereo or surround sound effect. I couldn't test this as I only had a single speaker to work with. Sony really ought to consider selling these in multi-packs if they're going to make such a big deal of this capability. I knew from my own research prior to getting this speaker that this capability only works with other speakers from this series. You can't use other bluetooth speakers from other manufacturers or even other models of Sony speakers to do this. That being said, the language in the app is very vague and makes it sound like you can grab any old bluetooth speaker to create a wireless speaker network. Curious to see if this was actually the case, I grabbed a pair of bluetooth speakers from other manufacturers and attempted to pair them. Sadly, as expected, neither one of them would pair. Second, the app's control of the customizable LED light ring isn't quite what I was led to believe given the packaging and documentation. My hope was to use this speaker with my home theater system and have it paired with my home theater PC rather than a phone or tablet. Given the speaker's ability to link up with other speakers, I'd had thoughts about maybe using this to eventually implement a wireless surround sound and/or whole home speaker system. My PC setup has a nice blue LED lighting effect, and I thought it would be cool to get the LED ring on the speaker to match the blue that the rest of my setup has. That's when I discovered the second shortcoming of the app. You can't select a single color for the LED ring to glow. The app only gives you a list of preset color schemes that you can choose to have it cycle through. You can't select just a single color and tell the speaker to hold it continuously (special PSA on the lighting: if you're epileptic, don't attempt to use this speaker until you adjust the color settings. By default, this speaker came in ""RAVE"" mode which has white flashing strobes along the left and right edges. There was no mention of this strobe effect in any of the materials I read prior to getting this speaker, and it's a little disturbing that this was enabled by default). Third, the voice control button within the app doesn't appear to actually do anything. Pressing it prompts you to say a keyword. I tried saying ""Sony,"" ""Speaker,"" ""Hey you,"" and ""Play Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody,'"" but I had no luck getting the app or speaker to react. Pressing the help button within the app didn't lead me to anything offering any support for this. Saying ""Google"" did pull up a screen with icons for Google Music and Youtube, but I couldn't get the app to do anything beyond that point using voice controls. Unfortunately, the shortcomings aren't limited to just the app. The speaker also has a button on the top for bass boost. Upon first using the speaker, I was very impressed by the sound. It was clear and loud with a lot of punch to it. Curious to see what it would sound like with even more bass, I pressed the bass button on the top . . . and the sound immediately went flat and tinny. Apparently, the bass button was already enabled by default. Given the way that this is set up, the bass button is less of a boost button and more of a ""make my music sound anemic and bad"" button. The perception would have been much improved had they not opted to have this enabled by default. Using the speaker on a phone call yielded mixed results. The audio came over both loud and crystal clear on my end. That being said, the person on the other line said that my voice was distant and full of distortion. Suffice it to say, that speaker's microphone isn't very good. A couple of warnings if you're going to try and use this as a speaker on a PC. First, you won't be able to control the speaker's settings from the PC. You're going to have to use the phone app to control things like power management and the LED lighting. Secondly, you're going to want to go into the power management options within the app to turn off the auto-off power saving feature. This feature is enabled by default. The speaker doesn't automatically wake after powering down. If you don't turn off the auto-off, then you will be forced to press the power button on the speaker to turn it back on after it powers down. The amazing thing is that despite the shortcomings that I've listed, I still really like this speaker. The LED lighting is fun, the sound is terrific with lots of volume and bass, and the aesthetic is nice and clean. Is the speaker perfect? No. Is the speaker really good? Yes. Despite the shortcomings, I'm still seriously considering buying another one to use in my home theater setup.

"I recieved this XB30, in exchange for my honest review...Not impressed with the sound from this bluetooth speaker. It has a Bassy & Dull sound to it! For 150.00, it Lacks Highs badly... For example, I have a 40.00 Phillips bluetooth speaker ( SBT300), that plays Clearer than this Sony. Also, the 40.00 Phillips, is 3x larger than this SRS-XB30 Sony! While the Sony has decent Bass, it truely lacks High frequencies. Highs, come across muddy.If you like Bass, and leds, this bluetooth speaker module is for you. If you like clear high frequencies, as I do. I reccommend skipping this, Id rather have better performing Speakers, vs the flashing and color changing leds!I do like that rhis has a rechargable battery, built in. You can also plug your phone or mp3 player directly into this for audio, via 3.5mm adapter. As well as charging, via supplied usb rear input.",3.0,150,0.16531250000000003,3,7,3,0.01734374999999999,-0.005319178153128878,-1
"This is the third Bluetooth speaker we have in the house which enables me to make a direct comparison to two competitors from different manufacturers. However the other two have price points higher than this Sony XB30 with a $149.99 MSRP (one is $50 higher and the other is $100 higher).The Sony comes in multiple colors and the outside of the case has a rubberized finish with metal grilles front and rear (the back one is for a passive radiator). The unit has a nice substantial feel to it and that combined with the feel of the controls gives the sensation of a quality made piece. The front grille is surrounded by a “light bar” that has a number of different preprogrammed colors and patterns along with a couple of white strobes, none of which appear to keep time or rhythm to the music being played. The “light show” variations cannot be accessed directly from the speaker’s built-in controls, you have to make changes from the SongPal app (which is free), but you can toggle the current light selection on or off using a button on the speaker. The jacks for power, audio in, and USB connection (to charge your phone from the speaker) are on the back of the speaker under a cover that has a water resistant gasket as the speaker is IPX5 rated for water resistance. Note that if the cover is open for a connection its water resistance is compromised.The Extra Bass function provides a nice bass boost that once you become accustomed to it, leaves the speaker sounding kind of “tinny” or “thin” when it is turned off. I did find the speaker to be lacking in treble both when playing files from iTunes via my iPhone 6 and when connected with a cable to an iPod Classic playing Apple Lossless files. The SongPal app has a rudimentary three-band graphic equalizer enabling you to adjust bass, midrange and treble from flat to +10 or -10 with three sliders. The bass and mid had a noticeable effect on the content I listened to, but the treble control had virtually no effect that I could tell.Two features I was not able to try out were the “Wireless Party Chain” since I have only one Sony speaker and the LDAC audio technology which is a higher quality Bluetooth connection which appears to be a proprietary Sony technology available on their ZX2 High-Resolution Audio Walkman and Xperia smartphones.I realize I am probably not in the target audience for this particular product due to my age, but I am a little confused by the combination of the “multicolored line light and flashing strobe” that would have probably appealed to the 12-year-old me along with the LDAC technology that comes in a $1200 hi-res music player that the 60-year-old me could afford but has difficulty rationalizing. I would expect someone with a high-resolution, audiophile-quality music player to be shopping wireless speakers at a much higher price point than this.The XB30 has a built-in microphone which enables you to have phone conversations using the device as a speaker/mic. Sound quality was far superior to the iPhone’s speaker phone function for both ends of the conversation (to be expected given the size difference of the speakers between the two devices). This feature helps the XB30 earn a place on your work desk.I think the XB-30 represents a good value for its price point given the additional technology and features it possesses when compared to the two other Bluetooth speakers I am familiar with, however the lack of treble response is a little disappointing, at least to me. Sound quality can be a rather subjective matter, and to be fair I was not able to judge its sound with it being driven by a LDAC capable device. There are many other players at this price level, so I suggest comparing at a retailer where you can listen to multiple speaker choices before making a decision.",4.0,661,0.10300546448087436,0,22,3,0.24849726775956282,-0.10166735231178559,-1
"I was excited to open the Sony SRS XB30, as my previous bluetooth speaker was relatively cheap, and left a lot to be desired, sound-wise.So, opening up the box, which in itself is nice and tactile, you are greeted straight away by the speaker. No messing around. Pulled it out and powered it up. The indicator in the SongPal app (I'll get to that later) showed 50% charge, so that was great, meant I could use it right out of the box. Sync'd it to my phone (without instructions) by pressing the big bluetooth button and then looking for it on my phone (just like you would with any other bluetooth device). Paired up really quickly. Chose my first song to play through it and away I went. Bam! The little speaker had a nice punch, straight out of the gate! I was very impressed, almost taken aback as I checked it out. Turned the volume up and it sounded great. Then, as anyone would, you HAVE to press the EXTRA BASS button. When you do, dual passive radiators work together with stereo full-range speakers to enhance the low-end tones, giving bass a nice boost — despite the speakers compact size. Basically, it sounds fantastic! However, I found that the speaker sounds fantastic, at a lower volume and when you are close to it. As I stepped away from the speaker and turned up the volume, the bass intensity dropped and more higher end sounds took precedence. I live in a moderately sized home with 25ft ceilings in the living room and the speaker was able to fill the room with sound, but didn't sound quite as bass-backed as it did when the volume was lower and I was closer to it. However, I am still very impressed with what this speaker can do, considering it's size. On to the SongPal app... I opened it up and got the speaker hooked up to it, and from there you can change many settings on the speaker. It has an illuminated LED ring around it and two strobe lights. You can turn them on and off and you can control certain colors of the ring with predetermined color pattens within the app. But you cannot directly choose the color with a color wheel. You can also check battery status, power settings, adjust the EXTRA BASS and more. The unit claims a 24 hour battery life (when not using the lights on it) and so far, it's living up to it's claims. You can connect via bluetooth as mentioned or also via USB.You can also link speakers, so if you have more than one of them, you can link them for stereo sounds. And if you want more, you can link up to 10 of them together for a full on party atmosphere! The speaker is also water-resistant, not completely waterproof. So don't drop it in the pool and expect it to work, but it is splash proof and spill proof, so you can take it and use it at the beach as long as you make sure that the internal components cover is securely fastened, as Sony mentions many times in the instruction manual!You can connect up to three devices to it as well, although I haven't tried this feature as I would only use it with my phone. I would love to see a power indicator on my phone as to how much power is left in the speaker. I use a pair of Sony Bluetooth Headphones (MDR-XB70BT) every day and they provide a little icon showing how much charge is left in them on my phone. That would be useful with the speaker, as I may not always use the SongPal app when using the speaker. As for the SongPal app, I had an issue with the speaker connecting twice to it, and then not registering either of them. I had to erase the speakers and reconnect them. Not a deal breaker but it made the SongPal app feel a little clunky. It would be nice to have a color wheel to choose individual colors for the LED ring around the speaker, but again, not a deal breaker, but a nice to have feature. Overall I am very impressed with the Sony SRS XB30 Bluetooth Speaker and I would recommend it to my friends without hesitation.",4.0,726,0.24523892773892766,5,32,2,0.17738053613053617,-0.17458326381196276,-1
"My son wanted a speaker to par with his phone for his 8th grade graduation.

"Spent more than an hour at the store listening/deliberating between Sony and Bose. Sony hands down won! Features like easy one touch pairing with my Samsung phone, long battery life, power bank charger, rubbery case is well made than Bose's plastic exterior, lights are awesome and classier compared to JBL's tacky lava-like lights and the SOUND is SUPERB!!! Was able to play it out of the box. Did not download the app, very satisfied with the quality of the sound. At max volume, sound frequencies like highs, mids and lows are maintained and does not get distorted thus I found no need to have an equalizer from the app. Always take into consideration the source ( Pandora, Spotify, Youtube, Mp3, etc ) you're getting the music from because it's crucial to the overall output of the sound. I listen to Pandora and recordings are consistently crisp, full and clear. Some sites have inferior recordings, no matter how much tweaking you do with an equalizer it will still produce an inferior, muffled and distorted sound. Another feature I've noticed is when paused for a considerable amount of time, it turns itself off. Compared to the XB40, XB30 IMO delivered a crispier, undistorted sound at max volume. XB40 was slightly louder, a given. Could not be happier with my choice. Growing up Sony was already a household name in quality and performance. With the proliferation of newer and good brands in the market today, Sony has retained its global reputation of excellence in electronics technology. Time spent at Best Buy wasn't wasted and was on sale. Lastly, the red is gorgeous! More like red orange.",5.0,273,0.2912457912457913,5,8,1,0.35437710437710435,-0.07526068576655864,-1
"After a few minutes playing with SONY's new XB30, I knew I was in trouble. Too many nieces and nephews who would feel left out if I gifted any one of them and not any of the others with this truly fun music box. Great sound, immense power handling, colorful, bright, and wickedly cool. Took mere seconds to get my laptop connected to the SONY XB30. Hit play and Adam Levine was sounding big, bold and great filling my large family room on this rather pint-sized sound box. Disconnected it from my laptop, and pulled out my iPhone 6. Within minutes I was playing Feist with perfect sound quality. My iPhone offered to download a Sony App to further control the XB30, but it was not necessary. It does let me adjust the volume from the App so I don't need to go up to the Sony XB30, but so what.The SONY XB30 has a few special tricks. A double click of the play button skips you forward. A 3 click pattern jumps you backwards in the song. It will apparently tie together with multiple SONY devices of this special EXTRA BASS SERIES so the kids can have a really loud party. Yikes. Oh . . . and it's a L-I-G-H-T S-H-O-W. Yeah, it lights up like an 80s disco. Shrink that massive boom box from the 70s/80s into a milk carton size (quart!), double the volume, add a light show and it connects with whatever music library you have on your phone. Not bad. Not bad at all. I'm gonna need to get a few more of these.SUMMARY: If there is something I could bring back from a visit to the 1980s, it might be the totally frivolous spirit of musical fun embodied by boom boxes. Boom boxes, for the too-young-to-know, were portable, but powerfully loud, all-in-one stereos that could entertain your moving party. Sony brings back all of the fun and eliminates the unnecessary. The ubiquitous smart phone has all the music you could ever carry, and bluetooth links to Sony’s powerful speaker. Add to the mix a light show using LEDs creating little burden on your portable power, you’re ready to go.",5.0,365,0.18443498325573798,1,21,2,0.40778250837213104,-0.0638768633071286,-1
"You can start a party anywhere with this speaker thanks to the built-in light show.PROs+ Sound quality: Obviously, one of the most important features of a speaker is the sound quality. The Sony XB30 certainly does not disappoint. Highs and mids come through clear and bass had some kick to it (if it's not enough for you, you can press the ""Extra Bass"" button for an enhanced effect). I tested streaming music from Apple Music, Pandora and Slacker Radio and was not disappointed with the sound quality of this speaker.+ Lights: I know some may find this gimmicky, but I really like the lights on this speaker. There is the outer ring that surrounds the speaker on the front that changes different colors and two white LED ""strobe"" lights on either side. You can set the lights to dance with the music, set a more calming lighting effect or turn off the lights completely by using the SongPal app. The lights really to add a bit of a party atmosphere and helps this speaker stand out from other brands.+ Bass booster: A quick press of ""Extra Bass"" button substantially increases lows and adds a great bass effect, especially considering the size of this speaker. However, it can make some songs sound a little ""muddy"" with an overemphasis on lows.+ NFC pairing: If your phone features an NFC chip, it can be used to quickly pair to this speaker with a tap. + Speakerphone support: You can answer incoming calls on this speaker by tapping the ""phone"" button. I tested this out and my friend said the sound quality was very good and he could hear me fine. However, if I stepped too far to one side, the noise cancellation feature seems to kick in and makes my voice harder to hear, so be sure you're in front of the speaker while using the phone feature.+ Siri support: You can also call up Siri by tapping the phone button and speaking a command.+ Bluetooth standby: A unique feature of this speaker is that you can leave it plugged in to an AC outlet and it will automatically turn on when you start playing music on your phone. It will go into standby mode (waiting for the next time you play music) if nothing plays for a period of time. This feature can be enabled in SongPal app.+ Charge your phone: The speaker has a USB port on the back. You can use your own charging cable to plug into this port and charge your phone while the speaker is on. This would obviously decrease the runtime of the speaker, but it can come in handy in a pinch.+ Pair with other Sony XB30 speakers: Another unique feature is the ability to pair this Bluetooth speaker with another similar Sony Bluetooth speaker. The other speakers must support the ""Wireless Party Chain"" function, which currently includes the SRS-XB20 , SRS-XB30 and SRS-XB40. Up to 10 speakers can be connected.+ Aux in: Non-Bluetooth devices can be used by using an audio cable with stereo mini plugs (not included).CONs- Proprietary charger: Unfortunately, this speaker cannot be recharged with a standard Micro USB or USB-C charger. It uses a barrel connector, meaning that you need to remember to bring the included charger with you (and make sure you don't lose it!). Fully charging the speaker takes about 4 hours.- No battery life indicator on iOS: Many newer Bluetooth speakers display their battery level on the iPhone/iPad status bar, so you can see when your speaker needs recharged. This Sony XB30 speaker does not do that, although you can use the SongPal app to find it (it's buried under the Settings option in the app). You can also hold down the ""phone"" button for about 3 seconds and the speaker will announce its current charge.- Buggy SongPal app: This speaker seems to use a separate Bluetooth connection when using the app, as I frequently receive messages from the SongPal app that my speaker needs to be paired even while it is currently streaming music from the same device. I've also seen multiple instances of the speaker appear in the app even though I'm only using one, so it looks like the SongPal app has some kinks to work out.Overall, I'm really happy with the sound quality of this speaker and the light show is a nice added bonus!",5.0,731,0.17791636141636144,2,21,1,0.41104181929181927,-0.122009455957519,-1
"I went to the store with the intent to purchase a Bose speaker. The Best Buy employee was great...he gave me the low down on all of the speakers in my price range (around $100), and gave me his personal opinion about this speaker...that it was the best sound for my buck. And he was right! It is as loud as you'd want a bluetooth speaker, and Sony's extra base makes it sound like a speaker you could use in your home as opposed to just on the go. It's 24-hour battery is WAY longer than any other I've seen...which I didn't think would even be something I'd need until the very first time I used it at our all day birthday party outside by the pool! I also didn't think I'd ever use the USB port until the second time we used it camping, and my phone died.

"i am using the gpx555 in a small commercial kitchen. it is a foregone conclusion that the acoustics are horrendous. moreover there are oven hoods, stoves, and hot and cold tables whooshing and rattling, machines spinning and making egregious screeching noises, fans blowing, buzzers doorbells and phones going off, and people shouting and cursing at each other and etc.the gpx555 has pretty good overall sound reproduction quality and plenty of volume even in this less than ideal setting. the volume control is stepless and increments in single values from 0-50. of course somebody had to mash it all the way up within seconds of the thing being plugged in, with some kind of pantera or slipknot or ratm crap. it sounded very loud, very good, and there was no discernible clipping or distortion. this lasted only a few seconds as it was much too loud (which is a good thing), and we settled on 35 for the rest of night: as loud as possible while still being able to communicate using raised voices (which everyone has to do anyway to be understood irrespective of any superficial tertiary electronically engendered harmonic dissonance)i was allocated a budget of 400usd and the only other unit i considered was the samsung mx js5000 for around 300usd because it had so many reviews. however again and again i heard people complaining about the lack of bass so i decided to go with the gpx555 because it had a dedicated 10 inch subwoofer.the only space i have available is on top of one of the coolers about 8 feet above the ground. i know from past experience that subwoofer placement can have a significant effect on the amount of bass that is output but floor space is at a premium and even if there was a corner of the floor available the proprietary cords that connect the head unit to all three speakers preclude the use of any normal monster cable extension.perhaps it is because the subwoofer is high above the ground and not near a corner, but i am really disapointed with the low frequency bass response. granted i didnt have very high expectations for an all in one shelf stereo priced at circa 380usd, but i was hopeful (read: naive) that the dedicated 10 inch subwoofer this unit touted which differentiated it from its peers would deliver some facsimile of accurate bass response.unfortunately at least in my location and application the low end just isnt there at all. contrariwise, there is some weak muddy midrange and high range bass to be sure, but i know the music i like well enough to really miss the low thunderous bass hits that should drop. i tried out some 2pac only god can judge me now and wonda why they call u bitchsic, some stevie ray vaughan riviera paradise, little wing and chitlins con carne, some bob marley time will tell and some ratatat songs from the album classics.all of these songs have some nice low frequency bass that hits you in the chest and rattles the walls and windows when it drops on a system with a capable subwoofer, but i did not hear any of the lowest bass while using this gpx555. by way of comparison another system i owned was comprised of some affordable recertified harman kardon separates i.e. a 2 channel receiver for 150usd, two bookshelf speakers for 150usd and a 12 inch powered subwoofer for 150usd and while certainly not spectacular i could at least hear the lowest of the low bass. i am of the opinion that you really cant get a decent subwoofer for under 400 or 500usd so i had no delusions about that recertified stuff, but it was in my price range and whilst it didnt play the lowest notes very loud, they were definitely audible.with the gpx555 i just didnt hear the notes from entire frequency ranges at the low end. i do not know the exact cutoff at the low end where it can no longer reproduce the notes, but if you have ever used winamp and played around with its 10 band equalizer, where the lowest slider is 70hz and the highest is 16khz then you may grasp that what i am speculating is that nothing below say 250hz or 180hz or somewhere around there is being reproduced.for frame of reference i listen to most of my music on a pair of sennheiser hd650 headphones with lossless flac shn or wav source output through winamp and i always finetune winamps 10 band eq into a sort of V shape with the lowest and highest sliders almost at max and then each slider between those two progressively lower such that the slider for 1khz in the very middle is almost all the way down at the center of the V shape.and what i can tell you is that the low notes in these songs i mentioned, those which are below the 180hz (2nd lowest) slider on the eq all hit hard and boomy and sound great on my headphones, and as such i anticipated hearing those notes from the 10inch subwoofer on the gpx555 but they just weren't there. i should point out that when using the gpx555 in this kitchen in addition to the sub optimal placement of the subwoofer, i am also not using a lossless audio source nor am i playing it through winamp and its 10 band eq.everybody just puts on youtube videos which i believe are all manner of lossy, and that flash or html5 player or whatever it is has no equalizer that i am aware of, and of course the left and right audio composite patch cord running from the computer to the gpx 555 is not gold plated, low guage, or nitrogen purged etc etc ad nauseam ad infinitum, ergo these shortcomings are indubitably degrading the sound quality.what i *have* done though, is to make sure that sonys bass boost, which on this unit they call bass bazuka or some inane crap, is turned on, and it does in fact make a very noticeable difference - when it is off there is absolutely no low end at all. when it is on there is a decentish() amount of muddy midrange and high range bass.this unit also has a dedicated control to adjust the level of the subwoofer itself, from 0-10db and i have this as high as it will go. there are also around 10 built in eq presets available which i have tried in an effort to get the bass to hit (you know that feeling you get in your chest when the bass drops) but i still am not hearing the lowest notes.it also has a custom eq setting which consists of only three bands that are not labeled with their numerical hz value, only low mid and high. i have manually set this as close as possible to the V shape i use in winamp with the low and high at max and the mids near minimum and this is the configuration i used to test the songs i mentioned.as far as build quality goes the sony gpx-555 is very plasticky and extremely lightweight for its size. now maybe headunit and speaker technology has changed since the time i picked up that hk stuff, but i was surprised at how light the speakers and headunit were considering their size and cost. maybe the weight of the magnet is no longer a necessary and sufficient variable to solve the equation for quality.all of the controls on this thing are ridiculously oversized, chintzy and not particularly tactile or sturdy feeling. i guess you could say they are all soft touch type buttons that have a lot of give it has a decent size display with graphics that look like something out of an alpine car audio headunit from 1995. the volume nob is the size of a grapefruit for some unknown reason (much too big).the face of the headunit and the cone of each speaker and the subwoofer all have led lighting the color and pattern of which can be changed or disabled entirely. honestly i would prefer it if sony had reallocated the costs accrued by this gimmicky nonessential lightshow into higher quality audio components on the headunit and speakers in an effort to provide better audio quality at the same cost.one of the selling points for us was that this unit was bluetooth and near field communication capable and somebody figured out how to get their phone to talk to it pretty easily so now they can control basically all the settings and choose the music at the cost of their data plan. it also comes with a small remote that is seemingly bereft of a mute button but replete with two aaa batteries.as stated previously the speaker wires are a. too short (i.e. 6ft maybe idk) b. have no speaker posts and c. use a proprietary connector that looks more like an ethernet jack than any else.something else i noticed, and again maybe this is just the way speakers have evolved, is that the actual woofer cones on the speakers and subwoofer do not move at all when music is playing. the cones on every other set of speakers i have owned move in and out in time with the notes and the distance traveled increases in direct proportion to the volume level.all in all i would say that if you dont care about low frequency bass, assuming that my inability to properly locate the subwoofer on the floor in a corner is not entirely responsible, then you would be pretty happy with this unit because it does sound reasonably nice and has plenty of volume, pretty flashing lights, bluetooth, eq presets and a (rudimentary) custom eq, and yes it looks sleek and black and shiny and sexy from the front (the particle board from the rear is a little disconcerting).notwithstanding the veracity of that antiquated adage re breaking speakers in effects an amelioration of thier phonic capabilities (headphone freaks swear by this but i didnt notice anything change with mine) i will be unequivocally verklempt if, after a few weeks of 15 hour per day usage, i throw on some aphex twin selected ambient works and am magically blown away by the earth shattering low frequency bass drops vis a vis richard d. james's irrefuteably gekkenhuis genius. we are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of the dreams. all of these moments will be lost, like tears in rain. godspeed.",3.0,1759,0.08331250631887574,0,3,1,0.058343746840562094,-0.11827693396211525,-1

"About 2 years ago I purchased a Sony LBT-GPX55 1600 watt stereo system that sounded amazing for the money. A few weeks ago I decided I wanted to buy the Sony LBT-GPX555 but when I got it I was very disappointed. The sound quality wasn't as good as my GPX55 system which would fill the room with bass and it sounded good no matter where you were standing or sitting. The GPX555 had decent bass but it wasn't very deep. But the old system had deep bass. I tried messing with the sound settings and making sure bass bazuka was on and no matter what I did nothing helped. After giving the speakers some time to break in as some call it, I still wasn't satisfied with the system. I contacted Sony and they gave me the recommended settings but it still didn't help. I have a friend who has the GPX555 and he herd my GPX55 and said mine sounded so much better. So he sold his and bought the GPX55 here on amazon. I liked the lights on the new system but I'd rather have better sound then speakers that light up. My GPX55 has lights on the front of the stereo that I think have a more aggressive and better look to them. So I returned the new system and bought a new TV instead. I would recommend the Sony LBT-GPX55 over this LBT-GPX555. I've seen the GPX55 go on sale for 375 many times but this GPX555 only goes on sale once in a while usually for 449.99. The wattage of the GPX555 is 1800 not 1600 but I think 1600 sounds better.",,277,0.22099217986314765,0,30,1,,-0.06969311087513319,-1
"My old Sony MHC-EC 909iP had the most brutal, wall shaking bass...but the CD player started skipping and stopping all the time so I bought this one. I ONLY use Sony audio because it's the best sound for the price.I was excited as I hooked up this new system and put some music on. While the sound is clear and powerful, the bass is hardly audible. This subwoofer is WEAK, almost like it's not even there! I'm a bass freak and was very disappointed. The salesperson at Best Buy said I could easily hook up the speakers from my old system...WRONG! I'm not happy about this lack of bass but everything else is okay.If you're looking for a system that has good sound and you DON'T need earth-shaking bass, you'll like this. But if you NEED THE WALLS TO SHAKE WITH BASS, you won't like this item. It's loud and has clear sound with no distortion at high volumes....nice but like I said, bass is seriously lacking even with mega bass on.

"I am an experienced home theater buff and am currently running these speakers with a 3.2kW 7.1 custom installed system in my home. I could not be happier with the performance of these speakers. People often over-estimate the need to spend big money on the rear speakers since all they do is produce the surround sound. I considered the BW ceiling speakers to match my front speakers, but at over 750 for those I determined it wasn't worth it. I'm of the opinion that it's not necessary to overspend and was looking for a 3-way option that has an adjustable directional tweeter. These fit the bill so I gave them a shot... wow! Great buy and they sound awesome! I would recommend these to anyone in a surround application, but I would definitely NOT use them for front speakers as they are just too small and won't produce enough sound on the lower end because of their smaller size.PS- the construction quality is top-notch and the installation was very easy in my ceiling tiles via drywall saw and the template they gave me. Install took 30 minutes or so per speaker.",,191,0.28901960784313735,2,9,2,,-0.017841709651029047,-1

We bought 2 Petcam's before this one. Returned the other two- one purchased at pet store. This one was so easy to set up and maintain! You can unplug and move it and you couldn't do that with petstore one without setting it up again. When any questions arose there's an 800 number for wonderful help! Recommend this one highly... ps after purchasing it reviews were read and this was reviewed horribly on one site. One person said great things and didn't understand the horrible reviews either. Perhaps the site was owned by a competitive company to make their competitor look bad. Thumbs up for this one!!!!,5.0,107,-0.053958333333333316,6,0,3,0.5269791666666667,-0.07216496343326628,-1

This WiFi camera can be used for monitoring pets or children. It could even be used for home security but it's not safe to put outside because it's not weatherproof. It was easy to initially set up. I had to connect to it with my iPad through WiFi and then download the Motorola Hubble Monitor app and it will find and register your camera. Once it's registered you can log in to the app at any time from any place and view live streaming with audio. The video quality is fair but nothing impressive. The audio signal sounds good. There is usually about a 3-5 second delay in the audio and 1-3 second delay in the video feed. I have had no problems logging on and viewing the video feed while I was away from home. You have the ability to view the video and talk to your pet and you can hear them as well. There is a two way microphone so you can actually interact with them even if you are 1000 miles away during a vacation. If you love your pets like I do then you will probably really like this system. The Hubble Monitor app allows you to adjust both sound and motion sensing levels and it will automatically start recording when it either hears a noise or picks up movement. This option will come in handy if you are wanting to check in on your pet while on vacation. You can view the live video but if they aren't currently visible on the camera then you can look at a time earlier in the day when the camera picked them up. The app gives you a timeline with information that is useful like periods of time that were all quiet or times when it picked up noise. It will also tell you when it picks up movement. When it picks up either sound or movement then it will start recording. This camera also has IR night vision and it automatically turns the night vision on when it gets dark.Read more,,345,0.23939393939393944,0,5,3,,-0.030930858511864834,-1

"Overall this is a nice pet/baby monitor with good features. The product comes as a camera that streams video through your Android or iphone/ipad. I plan to use it as a baby monitor and think it will serve the purpose well, with one or two reservations stated at the end of this review.First the good.1. Setup was pretty easy and was clearly guided by the included manual. Basically setup involves plugging in and turning on the camera, downloading the Motorola app (in my case from the Apple App Store), creating an account, and synching the device. It all worked pretty smoothly and Motorola deserves credit for that.2. I like the monitor interface: instead of having to keep track of a little camera monitor, you view the picture on your iphone or ipad, which is much more handy. To view the camera, simply click on the app you downloaded and the picture pops up right away. The app is simple and easy to use.3. The camera has some nice features, such as temperature display (and alerts), motion detection, a two-way microphone/speaker for communication, photo/video capture, and night vision, all of which seem to work well.But I have a few reservations about its features, particularly for the iPhone/iPad.1. For some reason, the software on the Motorola app seems to differ between the Android and the iPhone. The Android apparently lets you capture photos and video both, but the iPhone app only lets you capture photos -- no video. That being said, my iPhone app still records video *if the motion detection feature is on*, but this gives me less control over when the video starts and stops.Read more",,276,0.25062003968253965,0,3,4,,-0.021687068619042127,-1
"I purchased this camera so that I can watch my cat when I am away from home on weekend get-a-ways. The camera works with an app, called Hubble for Motorola that can be downloaded from the app store. I am somewhat satisfied with the camera due to its notification settings and ability to detect temperature changes and sounds, but unfortunately if I would have known about the plan that is required to utilize some features after the trial period, I would have gone with a different product.I'll start with some features about the camera that I enjoyed: I really like the fact that you can control the notifications to include things such as a preset temperature change, sound detection, and motion detection. I currently have mine set up to notify me of any movement near the camera, so I receive frequent notifications of any movement on my device. The camera can record a live stream or an action shot that is then stored on the app's cloud to be accessed at your convenience. I also like the fact that there is only a few second delay with the live feed, and the two way communication with the microphone is a really good aspect.Unfortunately, there were only two major things that I didn't like about the camera. After a period of 2-3 weeks, the camera is still a live stream video feed, but the motion triggered recording that I was previously enjoying is now only available by enrolling in a monthly plan. Essentially, now I am only getting notifications that include a photo of the motion that triggered the camera. Since my free trial expired, I am now only receiving pictures of my cat, instead of the recorded video. When I go to upgrade my plan, I discover that 30 days of the product features I was previously enjoying would cost me an additional 29.Read more",3.0,315,0.1515530303030303,0,18,2,0.0242234848484848,-0.04888054049951718,-1
"Below, I'll go into the struggle I had to get this thing setup - an effort which paid off for all of 15 seconds and then the camera went on a vacation never to return. Note: you need to run it in an Android or iOS app according to the Quick Start. The manual does, buried deep inside of it, mention something about also accessing it using Chrome. I used the iOS app. Blackberry, Windows or other mobile OS users don't apply here.After a setup with issues, but ones I dieseled through, I was running. After 15 seconds, the monitor went dark and the app said FW Updating. Presumably the camera's firmware was updating. That took 10 minutes or so.The FW Updating message was replaced with a Offline message. There was no obvious way to get it online again. The manual had no mention of offline in it or the troubleshooting section. I decided to run setup again. The setup seemed to work and the app gave the message Updating for 5 minutes. After that, it replaced the Updating with Offline. I did this a few times until I gave up. Then I called Motorola using the toll free line.I explained the issue to Tiffany. She asked me to hold to give her time to determine if the issue is with the app or the camera. She came back on the line to say the problem is the app but they don't support apps. To support the app, email 'supportmonitorseverywhere.com'. I did. It is an invalid email address. So I'm left with a useless monitor, a lost hour of my life which will never come back and an empty box my friend's cat will enjoy playing with.Now, here are some other issues. The monitor will only work on 2.4 gig WiFi. I had to setup a 2.4 gig WiFi because I run 5 gig here. The app won't run in landscape mode making it a real pain to use on a tablet.Read more",,333,0.007407407407407415,0,14,1,,-0.03751393699089678,-1

"As a dog owner, I have often wondered about what happens during times I can't see my dog. What does the dog do during the day if I am not there How does the dog react to various stimuli When exactly does the dog react to the car When I sleep, what is the dog doingWell, I have used other cameras for this purpose, but frankly, that is always a bit sketchy because I have no control over the camera and can't use it in the dark. Needless to say, I was really excited when I saw this camera offered.1. What's in the box: You receive the smaller camera (it is really small - about the size of your palm), plus some instructions and the power pack.2. Aesthetic: This is a functional item. However, besides being pretty small in almost aspect (about the size of your palm), it has a sturdy stand to sit on that you can swivel around, with a microphone on the back that can also be moved quite easily.3. Use:The first step after removing the camera is to get it online with your existing wifi network. This was a task I did not look forward to because these types of items typically will take a bit of doing to get going. Here, you are instructed to download the app for the device you have handy (for myself I used a Ipad) and then start the wifi acquisition process. The camera found my wifi network easily but it took a few tries for it to register completion.Once the set-up was complete, then the camera worked very well. Default settings immediately told me about happening around the camera. This includes both motion and sound. As the app is in place, notifications are sent to your device as often as there is activity.Actual use: I tried this in many different environments and times. Of course, there is a camera on this device and the quality is pretty good, although not complete HD. Second, and for me a most welcome part, is the infrared capability. Yes, actual infrared capability. And after testing this over many nights, it works very well. It even picked up both the occasional moth and mosquito flying around at night. It is pretty sensitive.The camera has the ability of two-way communication though the microphone (you simply hit an icon in the app to talk) and you can also play tunes as well by hitting another icon. In addition, you can take a photo as well if you want (access not yet). I have used the microphone function, and it works pretty well. The camera has provided some real enjoyment and revelation. Different sleeping places, more or less movement that you would think, and some real indications that dogs are pretty pathetic animals without social interaction - they MUST be in a pack for true security).The camera allows you to also watch in real time. With the microphone, you can communicate with your pet. As would be expected, there is a slight delay (2 seconds perhaps)so you have to keep that in mind. In addition, there is a temperature monitor (how cool is that) as well.Server: The app and computer log-in - under the strange and seemingly unrelated name Hubble - provides plenty of access (more on this in bit) - give you a timeline to look up various short (typically just about 15 seconds films of your chosen activity (dog, kid, etc) or more if these is a continued stream of activity. Plus, you can also see when there is just a sound - though it does not apparently record the sound. The timeline is ON a server, which means be careful what is recorded with this thing!Notifications: When this is powered on, the camera dutifully will tell you what is going on at home or elsewhere around the camera. You will receive a constant stream of alerts. Sometimes this is fine, but other times this will drive you nuts. And apparently there is no way at this time to maneuver the alerts to tamp them down. So, if you are in a business meeting, prepare to be driven crazy with the knowledge you dog has moved around. I expect this will be updated with a app update so this will probably be added later.App: The app at this time is pretty basic. You can look at the camera that is powered on and see the timeline of activity. You can simply scroll down and view the desired activity with your app. There is no apparent way to email the clips to yourself that I have found.Issue : The app goes to a cloud server. If the camera records something it shouldn't, then you can simply delete the clip by hitting the screen and a delete icon will appear. The camera itself is pretty inconspicuous, so it would be easy to have this record things you may regret later!The main point is that you must be really careful with the camera and the server. Second is it would be really terrific to be able to email the clips to yourself so you can edit them and do something with them other than just view the server. In addition, one concern I have is that it looks like there will be a charged service for at least some features as there is a plan tab (currently available is just free, however).Settings Again, at this time, the major issue with the app is it has very limited control. Although there is a tab that has settings, you can't do anything with it, and this means you can't control the notifications, for example. I hope this is addressed in a future software update.Overall: I enjoyed fooling around with this camera. The camera and the IF camera are quite sensitive. The microphone, when coupled with the video clips, is quite sensitive. For a dog owner (or cat owner - or whatever), the camera provides an easy, real-time, access through which you can see what is happening in your home ( or wherever that camera is placed with wifi of course). I have some concerns about server access ( I think this needs to be addressed with some further security measures as this is a cloud based service), but overall the experience is a lot of fun.I give this a strong 3.5 to 4 stars based on the above.

Yet, if you have the inclination, this is a pretty well integrated product.",4.0,1103,0.10658103592314118,2,23,1,0.24670948203842946,-0.14789169008569802,-1
This WiFi camera can be used for monitoring pets or children. It could even be used for home security but it's not safe to put outside because it's not weatherproof. It was easy to initially set up. I had to connect to it with my iPad through WiFi and then download the Motorola Hubble Monitor app and it will find and register your camera. Once it's registered you can log in to the app at any time from any place and view live streaming with audio. The video quality is fair but nothing impressive. The audio signal sounds good. There is usually about a 3-5 second delay in the audio and 1-3 second delay in the video feed. I have had no problems logging on and viewing the video feed while I was away from home. You have the ability to view the video and talk to your pet and you can hear them as well. There is a two way microphone so you can actually interact with them even if you are 1000 miles away during a vacation. If you love your pets like I do then you will probably really like this system. The Hubble Monitor app allows you to adjust both sound and motion sensing levels and it will automatically start recording when it either hears a noise or picks up movement. This option will come in handy if you are wanting to check in on your pet while on vacation. You can view the live video but if they aren't currently visible on the camera then you can look at a time earlier in the day when the camera picked them up. The app gives you a timeline with information that is useful like periods of time that were all quiet or times when it picked up noise. It will also tell you when it picks up movement. When it picks up either sound or movement then it will start recording. This camera also has IR night vision and it automatically turns the night vision on when it gets dark. The night vision works well and allows you to get a pretty good video even when it's pitch black out. The range is pretty good too.For the time being this recording option is free but it looks like this will be a pay service at some point. According to the hubble connected website it looks like the manual recording and streaming options will remain free but automatic recording is going to be a paid plan that you will have to subscribe to. There will be different paid plans depending on how long you want to be able to store video on the cloud. One option will retain all recorded videos up to 24 hours. The next plan will retain videos for one week and the last plan will retain videos for a month. This is the one thing that I don't like about this system. This camera has a high enough price tag that you shouldn't have to purchase a subscription in my opinion. I do like the system that they set up but again I wouldn't want to pay a monthly subscription fee.This camera even takes a temperature reading and displays in on your screen. You can even set it to alert you if the temperature goes below or above a certain level. This is another nice option for me because I can control my thermostat in my house remotely through my nexia home intelligence system if I need to.I like this camera quite a bit but I wish it was waterproof and I hope they don't start requiring subscription. Especially considering that there is no warning on the Amazon product page that tells potential customers that they may need to purchase a subscription in the future to get all of the benefits.,4.0,638,0.1980381739472649,0,12,3,0.20098091302636756,-0.07466665488891278,-1
"Between the cats' tendency to treat the camera as a very cool new form of toy (solved by the judicious application of duct tape) and my own struggles to make this work where I would prefer that it work -- on my MacBook Pro, rather than being required to use my smartphone (Android operating system) which otherwise I only use when I'm traveling and that now is beeping alerts at me constantly), this has still to completely prove itself to me as a device.On the positive side, even for a relative technophobe, I didn't find it impossible to install. The wi-fi connection gave me a few problems, and I may yet go back and try to do a complete reset and see if I can't get it running more efficiently (and remove the damn alerts). I have three cats, all of whom were adopted/rescued at different points in time, and who coexist uneasily in spite of having done so for a decade now, and on at least one occasion while traveling I was able to spot a spat brewing in the part of the living room where they spend a lot of their day time hours and avert it with a stern warning. One cat did a backflip in astonishment. Less to my credit, I'm afraid I also freaked out the cat sitter when she came to feed them, reminding her about some medication for one of the cats...Streaming is great, but I'm not thrilled about the idea of paying even a minimal amount for video recording and storage. Cats sleep a lot and just aren't ready for movie close-ups. Add up the sum that Motorola has conveyed is what it will be charging, and that's still the cost of three new books for my Kindle...I'm tempted to try to use this to help with the rescue of four stray neighborhood kittens, if I can figure out how to protect it from the weather and keep it close enough to a power source/wi-fi. In fact, now that I have it -- and I'm appreciating that this has good quality imaging -- I can imagine other uses, as well. Would I use it as an alternative to a home security system Probably not: those are more flexible and more user friendly, based on what I've seen. But if there's a window you like to leave open, or if you've noticed small items disappearing or there's a very location-specific home security issue that you're facing, well, that could work, too.For me, the jury is still out on precisely how useful this will be. I'll be testing it on more occasions when I'm traveling (I work from home) for a few days, and may yet opt to try a reinstall to see if I can get it working with the device that I WANT it to be working on. I don't need constant alerts -- with cats, it's not really an issue. All I really need is the ability to check in now and again to see if World War III has erupted and to intervene, like the Voice of God, if it has, and this may yet prove to be slightly more than I need.

"This Motorola Pet Scout66 Wi-Fi HD Pet Monitoring Camera gives you a good deal for your money right now with everything being free. To begin with the nicely compact Video Camera will give you a pretty good picture similar to HD with it's 720p screen. The camera also has digital zoom, infrared night vision which provided a pretty good picture in a completely black room and even gives you room temperature display and alerts.The two way communication provides ample sound. It's nice when you can both hear what is going on in a room as well as speak to whoever is in the room. Motorola is calling this a pet video camera, but in actuality, this would make a great security camera as well. Can you imagine pointing this inside your door, seeing a burglar and speaking to them I'm sure when you inform them that the police are on the way, they won't hang around too long.To use this Wi-Fi video camera, all you need is a Smartphone or Tablet, and if you want to be able to view also on your PC, you will need at least Windows 7 or Mac OS 10.7, along with Chrome 24, Internet Explorer 9, Safari 6 or Java 7. I have Windows 7 and Internet Explorer 9 and can view everything perfectly. There is a Quick Set Up that literally anyone can do in a couple of minutes. You simply plug the camera in, get your Smartphone or Tablet and download the Hubble for Motorola Monitors App from either the App Store for iOS devices or from the Google Play Store for Android devices. Run the Hubble for the App on your Smartphone or Tablet, follow the instructions to create your account, then log in and you are ready to access your live camera stream.The set up is really a breeze, but should you have any problems, there is a really thorough User's Guide, and if you need more help, there is an 888 number for a live customer service rep to help you. I had a problem with the camera connection, and found the easy fix in the User's Guide. My LED on the camera was slow blinking, but when the guide said to move it closer to the router, it worked perfectly.The important thing I have to tell anyone setting up your App account for this camera is to read everything during set up. I found out while reading that while there is now FREE motion and detection and Alert and FREE In-App Video Recording, it will not always be free in the future. I read that the still photos from the camera will always be free, but the videos will not. Also, as with all things from the internet floating free in space that can be stolen, the photos and videos streaming out there are encrypted for security and can only be accessed through your password, so they are as safe as they can be. But, it seems as though it wouldn't be a bad idea to turn off your camera when you are home though for your own privacy.All in all this is a nicely priced Wi-Fi Video camera with a good picture and sound, and with everything being pretty secure with it's encrypted pictures and your password protection, it's giving you a good deal, but I would love to know when the FREE motion detection and alert and FREE video recording will change to NOT FREE, what will it cost me then This is a good 4 Star Camera, as my still photos will always be free, but if I should want the video of a burglar robbing my home, how much will that cost me Until I know the future costs of the video recordings, this camera is only 3 Stars.",3.0,635,0.3205266955266955,0,19,1,0.06026334776334774,-0.10004104444150752,-1

"I installed these about two years ago. These baby's rock. They are installed on the outer portion of a covered patio, so they get a lot of exposure to the elements. Rain, and hot Texas sun. They are holding up great and sound as good as or better than when they were new (due to break-in).I don't buy into the cable marketing hype. I paid around 50 bucks for 100 feet of 12 AWG Wire from Big Box store. Nothing fancy, just wire on a black plastic spool. I bought one spool of 25' red, and one 25' green, to keep the polarities straight. Same cable different color.If I would have bought 16 AWG Monster (the largest they had, but the plastic sheathing on the Monster Cable was so thick that it looked bigger than the 12 AWG wire, and the wire itself looked thick because the clear plastic that Monster uses to sheath their cables magnifies the internal cable to make it look bigger. Wow.) It would have run me over 650. For smaller wire. Savings for not believing the hype600The length of your run should determine the gauge of your wire. Basically, the longer your run, the larger (smaller number) the diameter of your wire.I found the following information on Crutchfield's website that may be of use to those of you who want to run your wire for these speakers.Speaker Wire Lengths (Crutchfield)Distance from speaker to amplifier:Less than 80 feet, 16 Gauge80 to 200 ft, 14 Gaugemore than 200'12 Gauge.I could have gone with 14 AWG at my lengths, but I didn't think it would hurt go up in size. I've since read that using too large (smaller number) of a cable gauge can hurt performance, but there is so much conflicting information out there when it comes to home audio, I sometimes don't know what to believe.Read more",,311,0.10375802358560982,0,10,1,,-0.005895330412498678,-1
"I'm sitting by my pool right now jamming to some great music being presented to me by these Definitive Tech AW6500's and all I can think is awesome. I've been breaking them in for the past couple of weeks and they sound great!!!.I'm powering them with an older Flagship Onkyo Integra TXDS939 receiver and the frequency response and stereo separation is just WOW. I'm no stranger to Definitive's line of speakers as I have a pair of BP7001SC super towers in my home theater so I know what Great Sound sounds like.

"I picked up a pair of the AW6500 in a last minute decision. I was at Best Buy for a different reason but decided to take a look at their outdoor speakers. I wanted to listen to them but there was only the AW5500 on display, so the associate that came to help me kicked on the AW5500. Well, IT sounded pretty good, and when I say IT, that's because only one of the speakers was working, but just buy itself it sounded really good. So the associate says that the AW6500 were on sale and I figured if just that one AW5500 sounded good two of the 6500 should be even better. Got them home, hooked them up and hung them on a cross beam in my carport about 2 feet from my house with the bass towards the outside stucco wall so the bass could bounce off of it. I hooked them up to a older Sansui AU317 amp. that has a 50 watt output and then tied my IPod to it, put on some live blues tunes and cranked it up, WHAT A PERFECT MATCH!!!! The sound comes thru crystal clear, excellent highs and the bass is unbelievable for the size of the cabinets. The placement of the speakers really make a big difference too, because of the wood structure of the carport tied into the house, the bass really radiates thru out the carport, especially when I stand in the sweet spot where both speakers can be heard. One of the better choices I've made in a while.",5.0,262,0.2432079414838035,4,19,1,0.37839602925809823,-0.058226512746541226,-1

"I am no audiophile but these speakers are incredible for the price. If you are into the idea that high-dollar speakers are better because they cost more then this review is not for you. I have a 2004 Mitsubishi Montereo Sport (without the Infinity system installed) and the passenger side stock speaker was blown. I decided to shop around for not only for middle-priced speakers but also a brand name that was reputatble.Not only did I get more than I bargained for, I liked them so much, I swapped out the entire SUV!I replaced the front speakers first and did a test run ( I listen to Metal music) and the sound was clean and crisp on the highs and the lows were not bad either. Don't get me wrong, you are not going to hear the lowest of the lows with these speakers but the sound quailty of the bass was more than adequate.I could definitely tell the difference between the new SPE-6000's and the stock in the back. For the price and quality, I decided I wanted to change out the rest of the vehicle. Let's say I am very pleased with these speakers and I do recommend them.

"These speakers are great, bang for the buck wise. I have these hooked up straight to the head unit, and they still sound great. Before I talk about the speakers, I'll tell you about my past experiences with car speakers.I first replaced my front speakers with Kenwood KFC-1665's that sounded much better, but not great. A bit later, I purchased JBL GX602's from Best Buy. I splurged by spending over 100 bucks, thinking that they would sound great, and thinking the 2 ohm gimmick would let them be driven harder. Boy, was I wrong. The midbass was weak and distorted, mids felt recessed, and the tweeter had sibilance (sharp hissing S sounds) that cut into your eardrum and made them practically unlistenable. The speakers are pure marketing - the swiveling tweeters and plus one cone design are just gimmicks meant to make you think that they are worth more than they actually are, and pay 100 for a pair of speakers that sound worse than 40-50 ones. After about 2 weeks of owning them, I brought them back and exchanged them for these bad boys, which cost less than half the price, but sound twice as good. These Alpine's get louder off of the head unit, too, despite having a lower DB sensitivity rating of 88.5, versus 92 on the JBL's.The lows are surpisingly clear and loud, and even on bass heavy songs, have very little distortion. You'll still want a sub, especially if you listen to hip hop or electronic music, but these aren't lacking in the lows. Midbass is tight and hits hard. The mids sound slightly veiled compared to other speakers I've heard, but are still clear and clean. Upper mids are a bit harsh, but clear otherwise, and not at all obnoxious. These shine on the treble - The highs feel very clean, crisp, and clear without being too loud or harsh or having any sibilance. The staging is good, and there feels like there is more depth to the instruments than some car speakers I've heard. The only complaint that I have is mounting - The basket is very thick and wide, and may not fit into some mounting brackets (not included, by the way) without some persuasion.So in short, these speakers are absolutely 100 worth it for the price. However, the absolute most important thing of all is acoustically sealing your door. Since the panels are coming off anyways to put the new speakers in, peel back the plastic weatherproofing material on the inside of the door. Cut out pieces of wood, plastic, or even cardboard that fit over the large holes in the door, and seal them off. It can also be a good idea to cut out a piece of foam to fit between the door and side panel, as it absorbs rattles and keeps the soundwaves where they are supposed to be. Trust me, it sounds dumb, but for 20 minutes and 5 dollars these will go from sounding better than the stock speakers to sounding bonkers, in a good way.",5.0,510,0.1292261153198653,0,11,1,0.43538694234006736,-0.057393410771878095,-1

"The Bowers & Wilkins P7 over-the-ear headphones are, hands down, some of the best consumer/professional level headphones you can buy. There is virtually nothing wrong with them beyond being every-so-slightly tight fitting.You are given the immediate sense you’ve purchased something special. The packaging is simple, elegant, and compact on the outside. Upon opening the box, the headphones are folded by themselves in a molded case. And what a great thing that is! Highlighting the design of the B&W P-line is essential to the overall experience, as there is nothing like them. Besides the use of high-quality materials (aluminum, sheep’s leather), the metal frame curves around the square-shaped full-sized ear cups in a graceful way. The hinges that allow them to fold more compactly are solid and industrial-feeling. The ear pads are attached magnetically to the cups, and gently pulling and removing them reveals the drivers beneath. The leather padding on the ear cups and head band is soft and thick. And adding to all of this tactile and visual joy is the smell of leather. It compliments the ‘first experience’ with them in a way that I’ve not had with other headphones.Pulling up a small tab on the molded case reveals a leather carrying pouch, a simple instruction manual, and a spare 3.5mm cable. That’s it. It’s simple and encourages one to get on with the reason why you made the purchase to begin with.If you were impressed by the design, the sound is only more so. It’s obvious there was a meticulous amount of attention in how sound is delivered through the P7s. There is a level of detail revealed here that is stunning to hear. Music comes to life in all frequencies of the sound spectrum. Lows are rich and punchy with no overt boom or distortion. Mids are exposed and centered enough to be able to easily hear without inducing ear fatigue. And highs are light, crisp, and full of detail. For being close-backed headphones, the sound stage is surprisingly large and open. There are times where it’s easy to forget you are wearing a set of headphones and not listening to a high-end stereo system in front of you. Part of this is due to how excellent the sound isolation is and part to how superbly well-delivered the audio is.It feels like B&W has gone to great lengths to make the P7s reproduce recorded audio the way an artist, producers, and engineers intended it to be heard. Instrumentation has an extremely high-degree of separation on almost every track I’ve listened to, the exceptions being on those recordings that were not great to begin with. And headphones like this allow for one to hear the extra dimension added from the environment where the recording was made. For example, if something was recorded in a small room, you can hear all of the audible nuances that come with recording in that small space. Symphonic music feels rich, huge and detailed. Rock albums feel aggressive and full of attitude. Electronic, jazz, contemporary, industrial…you name it, these headphones faithfully reproduced audio in ways that continually surprised me. This is refreshing, as it highlights the fact that so many consumer headphones add ‘filler’ to their signature. In other words, accuracy of the music is not the end-goal; selling a certain kind of sound associated with the headphone is. This is fine if you enjoy one or two particular types of music, but the limits become apparent when you go outside of that box.While on the pricey side, the B&W P7s are worth every penny, as they are in a class all their own. From the product presentation to the design to the listening experience, the attention to detail is borderline obsessive and",5.0,621,0.2453275206796334,1,4,3,0.37733623966018326,-0.0855105266316718,-1
"There are very few things these days that are worth every penny. This pair of headphones is one of them. The sound quality is as good as all the other reviews indicate so I won't re-create the wheel. I have tinnitus and sometimes it's difficult for me to hear the TV or stream a TV show or movie without having to turn the sound up (probably why I have tinnitus). I live in a condo and playing music, TV or movies loud is not an option. These headphones help to focus the sound to my ears rather than the whole room let alone the building. I don't have to play them loud to enjoy the sound or hear the words. They tend to get a little snug but not so much as to outweigh the overall sound quality. As for the quality of construction and materials, you get what you pay for. The leather is soft and supple, not plasticy or sticky on the skin. The metal parts are well made and give the headphones a very nice appearance and feel. And finally, I have a big fat head. I gave away my Beats/Monster headphones because they were too tight on my head. These headphones have plenty of room for my massive cranium and are comfortable to wear for the length of a movie.I LOVE MY HEADPHONES ! ! !",5.0,230,0.1794343156843157,3,13,1,0.41028284215784216,-0.01888975213971067,-1
"I really liked these and wanted to keep them because they make one heck of a first impression but I ultimately had to return them. Removing the lid of the box greets you with the unmistakable smell of brand new, genuine leather. From the thick headband to the ear cups, this baby is soft, premium leather all the way. The metal frame that connects them is strong and gives confidence that they're not going to accidentally bend or break from anything but an almost intentional force against them. Here's my first comparison to it's peers. Most every other set, even over $300 is almost completely plastic. This is solid metal and leather through and through and it's heavier than its competitors for it. That's already a striking difference and makes a good argument for a higher price tag. It's obviously a higher quality product with better materials. I also like that the ear cups are removable and magnetically attached. Should there be an unrepairable break or tear, just buy a new set and pop them on. Underneath the left cup is where the cord attaches. This is also a great idea as the port tends to get damaged when the cord is pulled or water seeps in. You can tell there was a lot of thought put towards the design. The picture doesn't do these justice. They impress from top to bottom. One thing they don't look like is something you want to sweat all over or wear on rainy days so have something else for gyms, sweltering heat and storm season outdoors. They're also softer than they look. The ear pads are filled with memory foam so they're very soft to the touch and the headband is also nicely padded. I also like the added thickness on top. They did feel good at first when I put them on, but I felt some discomfort during my hours of wearing them. The clamping pressure started to make my upper jaw, under my ear ache. They seal very well and isolate from most of the outside noise. They're easily the best noise isolating headphones I've ever put on. They fold in on both sides to fit easier in a small bag or case, making them more portable. The ear cups don't swivel though.I'll be honest here about the sound. I have to say, I came away disappointed. They don't sound bad by any means but they're warmer in the mid range that I like which sacrifices some of the treble that I'm used to. I cycled through a variety of different types of music and when comparing them directly against my Audio Technica M50X's, they didn't blow them away, which is what I was kind of expecting them to do given their price point and reputation. I then realized that it wasn't a realistic expectation because my M50X's are actually very good headphones and nothing is going to make them sound like garbage. I thought the P7's would outperform them so well that I'd just ditch them completely. That didn't happen. In fact, I'm now convinced that it's probably not wise to expect any competent set of headphones to be rendered obsolete by a more expensive set like these. If you have a good set already that's at least over $100 to $200 and up by well established companies like Sennheiser, V-Moda, Beyerdynamic, Bose, Audio Technica, Sony, etc. (intentionally omitting the over priced and overrated Beats), the P7's won't completely redefine good sound for you. At least they didn't for me. Once I got over that, I focused in on what they are and what they do well as much as what they do differently than what I already have. My M50X's are just a notch above neutral in bass and treble with no mids which is something I like about them. These are a different flavor altogether. The mids and lows are much more pronounced, pushing vocals to the forefront. Beck was practically singing right in front of my face when I played some of his music. Stringed instruments in classical and jazz genres also received a big boost from the extra attention. Cello's, harp's and stand up basses were much fuller than my other set ever told me. Bass kicked electronic music (Daft Punk, Deadmau5) up a few notches over my AT's as well but never got overbearing or obnoxious. I really like the deeper bass and thicker overall sound on bass heavy music but I'm not a bass head so I don't want bass drowning out the instruments and vocals either. It sounds like it's getting close to the threshold of going over the edge but never getting there. I like a lot of rock music too which is something my AT's can do very well. Most of the bands actually sounded better on them than on the P7's which is probably due to the treble coming down a couple of notches. I prefer a V shaped sound, favoring the treble and bass. In fact, I usually have the treble dialed all the way up on my EQ's, so I missed that high sizzle from cymbals and snap from the snare drums. I also couldn't distinguish all the instruments as well on harder tunes with heavier distortion on the guitars. On a particularly heavy song, the high hat cymbal was almost completely drowned out and it took my M50X's to remember how much I should be hearing it. The extra emphasis on the mids and bass made the sound fuller but muddied the separation. The P7's made most everything sound better and outperformed my M50X's just not it the rock category which is a big one for me. They came up short according to my tastes. Headphones originally priced at $400 shouldn't have such a glaring weakness. They should do everything really well but don't. That was the main reason why I had to let them go.Outside of music, the P7's also worked well with T.V. shows and movies. Vocals came through clearly and soundtracks and effects delivered a more home theater like experience. The extra oomph really delivered on action scenes and dialog was more distinguishable. My M50X's held their own while doing a direct comparison though.There are 2 cords provided and the one attached for Apple devices included controls that worked flawlessly with my iPad. The cord even feels better in comparison to others I've felt. A drawback is the included case. While it's nice to receive one and it is of the same fine leather as found on the headphones, I'm not a fan of soft cases. Especially not for expensive electronics. It'll do fine for around the house or light travel use but if you're going to put these in a suitcase or travel far and frequently, I'd have my reservations. These are well worth a little extra money to protect them from falls, drops, getting sat on or being crushed by other bags. The included soft case also looks more like one of my wife's make-up bags which is a bit of a turn off. That's a very minor gripe though.In conclusion, these are premium, luxury headphones. The look like it, feel like it, smell like it and but come short of sounding like it which is what matters most to me. If you've already invested in a decent set of headphones, they won't completely redefine portable listening for you but they'll provide you with a quality product that's physically head and shoulders above everything else I've seen on the store shelves.I still do recommend these for people who want a premium build and appreciate warmer sounds. For heavy vocals, stringed instruments, and almost everything else, they're still very good. Hard rock is their achilles heel though. I'm just like hearing that separation amongst the distortion. I now have a greater appreciation for my M50X's though. Going head to head against a high end headphone like the P7 and coming out on top is pretty remarkable and even though it was a tough decision, that was the main reason why I couldn't keep them. I just couldn't justify paying $300 for a set of headphones that didn't completely outperform my M50x's, are actually lacking the treble that I like and hurt from the extra clamping force. But they sure are nice looking.",4.0,1389,0.1836487159113742,0,35,1,0.20817564204431294,-0.18117229669277102,-1
"I have owned and tried Sennheiser Momentum, P5, P3, Klipsch 4i, Etymotics, Grado's, Shure's, and more... Obvsoily these are a combination of in-ear, open and closed headphones.Bottom line...I have NEVER had my hands on ANY type of ear/headphone that sounded as good, nearly as beautifully made, and comfortable as these. I would be surprised if they don't wind up in MOMA in NYC like Movado's.Sound Quality specifics...2nd to none instrument/voice separation with close but awesome soundstage, tight and appropriately strong bass, great mid-range, unbelievable and again appropriate highs (again 2nd to none), many people claim you can hear new details with certain gear - with these OH MY YOU WILL, isolation is great while actively listening and does a great job of shielding sound from outsiders.They are so efficient that my ipad and phone drive them as loud as I could bear - amazing for such large over the ear drivers.If you love music and sound at it's best and love to get ""lost"" in it, I know of no better place on earth unless you are prepared to spend well into 4 digits.The only downside...$400 is a lot of money, especially for headphones. However, I can safely say they blow away anything in this price range and they are physically a work of art. Lastly, they smell beautiful, really. Other reviewers have described the smell similar to what the inside of a ""Bentley"" or ""Rolls Royce"". It seems crazy to say it but it is no exaggeration, really.",5.0,249,0.2802840909090909,0,15,1,0.35985795454545455,-4.050033328351077e-05,-1
"As a bit of an audio nut I picked up these and some C5s at the same time. They both fit the ways you'd expect, with these wanting a much better source than my Note 3, and the C5s shining on either source. The audio on these is incredible on a decent source. On my phone there is good quality, but not the ""sitting right next to a live band"" feel you get when these have the power they want. I'll go more in depth on some particular songs at the end, but first comfort. As someone with goofy large ears and a big noggin, these are comfortable for a couple hours if I don't have my glasses on. With my glasses on, they are a bit tight and very noticeable after an hour and a half or so. The build is fantastic and the case is nice. Very luxurious head phones to look at for sure. As far as songs go, I don't have a dedicated external headphone amp yet, still deciding which route to go, but these were listened to off of my programming/gaming rig which has an Asus ROG motherboard which has a decent headphone amp built in.Make Them Suffer-Elegies: I am a metal head primarily and this is probably my baseline song because there is a ton going on. This song is an atmospheric story telling of how the vocalist lost someone very near and dear to him, his screams, the furious instrumentals, the sad piano, and explosive breakdowns typically put headphones to the test. These pass that test very well. They capture the music in a big way. Every instrument has it's place and the atmosphere is flawlessly created for a heartwrenching experience.Hans Zimmer- The Dark Knight soundtrack is incredible on these. Really nothing more I can say other than if you have ever seen an orchestra perform this type of music in an auditorium, that is how these headphones sound. Incredible.Magna Carta Holy Grail: I don't really like or listen to rap much, but this song is well produced so it's a good test. These wouldn't be the ideal rap headphones to say the least, the piano and JT really sound awesome, the bass is not incredibly powerful, these are very much rock and classical headphones, which is perfect for me, but if you listen to electronic or rap, I would look into V-Moda Crossfades or Sol Reoublic Master Tracks.Overall, if you listen to music deep into instrumentals and singing or screaming vocals, these are perfect!",5.0,422,0.2598083431719795,1,9,1,0.37009582841401023,-0.03175906373444515,-1
"Man, do these make one heck of a first impression. Removing the lid of the box greets you with the unmistakable smell of brand new, genuine leather. From the thick headband to the ear cups, this baby is soft, premium leather all the way. The metal frame that connects them is strong and gives confidence that they're not going to accidentally bend or break from anything but an almost intentional force against them. Here's my first comparison to it's peers. Most every other set, even over $300 is almost completely plastic. This is solid metal and leather through and through. That's already a striking difference and makes a good argument for a higher price tag. It's obviously a higher quality product with better materials. I also like that the ear cups are removable and magnetically attached. Should there be an unrepairable break or tear, just buy a new set and pop them on. Underneath the left cup is where the cord attaches. This is also a great idea as the port tends to get damaged when the cord is pulled or water seeps in. You can tell there was a lot of thought put towards the design. The picture doesn't do these justice. They impress from top to bottom. One thing they don't look like is something you want to sweat all over or wear on rainy days so have something else for gyms, sweltering heat and storm season outdoors. They're also much more comfortable than they look. The ear pads are filled with memory foam so they're very soft to the touch and the headband is also nicely padded. I also like the added thickness on top. While they did feel a little clampy when I first put them on, I never felt any real discomfort during my hours of wearing them. They also seal very well and isolate from most of the outside noise. They're easily the best noise isolating headphones I've ever put on. They fold in on both sides to fit easier in a small bag or case, making them more portable. The ear cups don't swivel though.I'll be honest here about the sound. I have to say, I was a little disappointed at first. I cycled through a variety of different types of music and when comparing them directly against my Audio Technica M50X's, they didn't blow them away, which is what I was kind of expecting them to do given their price point and reputation. I then realized that it wasn't a realistic expectation because my M50X's are actually very good headphones and nothing is going to make them sound like garbage. I thought the P7's would outperform them so well that I'd just ditch them completely. Well, that didn't happen. In fact, I'm now convinced that it's probably not wise to expect any competent set of headphones to be rendered obsolete by a more expensive set like these. If you have a good set already that's at least over $100 to $200 and up by well established companies like Sennheiser, V-Moda, Beyerdynamic, Bose, Audio Technica, etc. (intentionally omitting the over priced and overrated Beats), the P7's won't completely redefine good sound for you. At least they didn't for me. Once I got over that, I focused in on what they are and what they do well as much as what they do differently than what I already have. My M50X's are just a slight notch above neutral in bass and treble with no mids which is something I like about them. These are a different flavor altogether. The mids and lows are much more pronounced, pushing vocals to the forefront. Beck was practically singing right in front of my face when I played some of his music. Stringed instruments in classical and jazz genres also received a big boost from the extra attention. Cello's, harp's and stand up basses were much fuller than my other set ever told me. Bass kicked electronic music (Daft Punk, Deadmau5) up a few notches over my AT's as well but never got overbearing or obnoxious. I really like the deeper bass and thicker overall sound on bass heavy music but I'm not a bass head so I don't want bass drowning out the instruments and vocals either. It sounds like it's right on the threshold of going over the edge but never getting there. I like a lot of rock music too which is something my AT's can do very well. A few bands actually sounded better on them than on the P7's which is probably due to the treble coming down a couple of notches. I prefer a V shaped sound, favoring the treble and bass. In fact, I usually have the treble dialed all the way up on my EQ's, so I missed that high sizzle from cymbals and snap from the snare drums. I also couldn't distinguish all the instruments as well on harder tunes with heavier distortion on the guitars. The push to the mids made the sound fuller but muddied the separation a little more. For most everything, The P7's did everything better and outperformed my M50X's. They just came up a little short a few times according to my tastes.Outside of music, the P7's also worked great with T.V. shows and movies. Vocals came through clearly and soundtracks and effects delivered a more home theater like experience. The extra oomph really delivered on action scenes and dialog was more distinguishable.There are 2 cords provided and the one attached for Apple devices included controls that worked flawlessly with my iPad and iPod. The cord even feels better in comparison to others I've felt. My one drawback is the included case. While it's nice to receive one and it is of the same fine leather as found on the headphones, I'm not a fan of soft cases. Especially not for expensive electronics. It'll do fine for around the house or light travel use but if you're going to put these in a suitcase or travel far and frequently, I'd have my reservations. I'm ordering a hard case for just such uses. These are well worth a little extra money to protect them from falls, drops, getting sat on or being crushed by other bags. The included soft case also looks more like one of my wife's make-up bags which is a bit of a turn off. That's a very minor gripe though.In conclusion, these are premium, luxury headphones. The look like it, feel like it, smell like it and sound like it. If you use or have already invested in a decent set of headphones, they won't completely redefine portable listening for you but they'll provide you with a quality product that's head and shoulders above everything else I've seen on the store shelves. I probably would've had some buyers remorse had I paid the original $400 asking price for these but at $280 on Cyber Monday, it would take a lot to convince me that there's a better made and sounding headphone than the B&W P7. This is one of those rare times where getting what you pay for turns out to be a good thing. Highly recommended for music listeners and those who appreciate a little luxury every now and then.*Note: After Cyber Monday, the P7's went up to $350 which looks like their new standard asking price. That still seems like a pretty good deal and keeps them at the top of the heap in that price range.",5.0,1248,0.1840408488011228,0,29,6,0.40797957559943865,-0.19940356239058987,-1
"DO NOT BUY THESE!I want to preface this review by saying that I have purchased over 50 sets of heaphones over the years, and used 100s of them to listen to music. I have bought and used sets from all categories and pricepoints, including professional musician in-ears meant for stage performance, and those meant for recording studio monitoring and producing records.When I saw this set of headphones for half off, I quickly ordered them. They seemed to fit the bill of what I was looking for, and the reviews were deceptively high. I needed something sturdy enough to handle the work environment, and something capable enough to receive bluetooth in an obstacle laden work area. I spend most of the work day in a laboratory, not at a desk. Maybe this is a suitable product for those whom are allergic to getting their hands dirty.It was my oversight that this set only has 40mm drivers. The lack of bass response shows this, especially at higher volume. I have an extremely capable pair of audio technica ATH-ESW9 that way outshine this set without breaking a sweat.These headphones are also lacking a fwd/rev skip button to move to the last or next track. It is also used to rid your ears of that extremely annoying youtube ad. That is a huge design flaw in my opinion! Ads will not be disappearing any time soon, and my cheap motorola behind the neck bluetooth headphones from years back have this feature! When you place your phone 20-40 feet away at your desk, it is not convenient to just touch the screen and do this manually.I was also disheartened to see that when I set these down on a sheet of paper on my desk, the printed words bled through into the ear cup material. That is something I have not ever seen a headphone do, no matter what color or pricepoint. Whatever dye they use for these must be poor quality, as they are also turning yellow after only a few weeks of daily use.The battery life is longer than any other set in the price point, and was a welcomed plus.The graduated ambient sound monitor is nice in theory, but really is not that noticeable. It is better to just slide one ear cup behind your ear instead.If HARMAN had spent more money beefing up the basics, this set would be so much better than the competition.I will be returning these, as I cannot justify keeping them, even at half price!",2.0,418,0.08322822822822826,4,17,1,0.14161411411411406,-0.08804184398437254,-1
"I used my Bose QC20i as my primary noise cancelling headphones for a long time but became frustrated with the in ear style so I decided to pickup an over-the-ear set. It boiled down the offering by Bose, beats and JBL.I noticed these in the Sunday ad and how they were a ""Best Buy Exclusive"" so I went down to a store to check it out. They have a really nice display that worked which went a long way. If you have been to stores sometimes this is not the case.Before I tried them on I did a quick Google search for some details and it came up with all the of marketing splash, it is all words until you try them out in my opinion. What struck me initially trying them on is the seal around the ears. They are very comfortable on the ears and seal very well. After wearing the headset for about an hour it starts to fatigue the top of the head. Looks like they chose to make the ear the comfortable spot which is fine.The audio sounds great, comparable with the beats in a good way. I am not a fan of the sound of the Bose headphones, they have that Bose sound which is like audio Doritos, always the same consistent sound but never blows you away lol. The NXTGEn Active Noise Cancelling technology is very interesting. Having come from Bose I had very high expectations and I would say that JBL has met those expectations and exceeded them in a few key ways, namely the Ambient Awareness. This feature is cool in that it allows you to hear what is going on around you to a degree based on preference. This would have been perfect for studying with my cohort back in school when you wanted to kill all of the background non-sense but wanted to still be able to hear someone crack a joke or ask an interesting question on a tough problem.I think one of the coolest parts of this product is the app that you can download. I did not even know about it until I Googled it and it makes all the difference. You can set your own EQ, turn On/Off the Noise Cancel and set the level of the Ambient Aware independently for each each with is great. The hearing in my left ear sucks from driving with the window down all the time so it is nice to customize to each ear.I attached some pictures of the app. One of the other cool things which I still do not understand how they do it but it is called TruNote. I guess it measures your head and tunes the headphones for it. I really like this feature as I usually am wearing glasses of some kind so this really helps when they are on. I did an A/B comparison with it on and off it the music was especially clear when I used the TruNote calibration.The built-in mic is okay but it seems like it is too far up on the headset for it to be really legit. It works but I would say that I get better performance from the QC20i hanging dongle thingy.I would recommend this to anyone looking at a 299.99 price range headset that wants great sound and utility. I cannot stress the utility enough the app really makes this headset very versatile, whether for use in the office to drone out the HVAC that always runs or for general listening in any situation.",5.0,591,0.2575838041431261,0,24,1,0.3712080979284369,-0.10023527612044614,-1
"Just don't. Go with something that at least looks sharp if you have money to blow. These Bluetooth headphones don't come with their own USB transceiver and the microphone is designed for a phone only and won't work with a USB adapter and Skype. The sound is actually muffled and has less depth than my $50 Logitech Bluetooth headset. If you do want to plug them in and use the cord, the cord that comes with them wouldn't reach to my pants pocket and it uses a non-standard connector. The first pair I got bricked when I paired it with my PC. In the end, I returned the replacement because it was such a huge disappointment. I was really looking forward to noise canceling headphones but the noise canceling just adds a layer of random white noise to your music that changes in volume based on the ambient noise. It doesn't seem to cancel anything, it just has this annoying hum that changes volume with whatever is going on around you. I was REALLY disappointed with these headphones. They could have at least made them LOOK fancy...",1.0,187,-0.09950980392156862,0,10,9,0.2502450980392157,-0.008249712457370384,-1
"Call myself an audiophile, but I'm really just someone who LOVEs all kinds of music across genres and ages. I've always enjoyed the peaceful isolation of headphones and evolving stereo. With Bluetooth causing less distortion to sound and improved noise cancelling /ambient technology for wireless headphones, I decided time to upgrade and look at the usual suspects. Sony did have a great, great product at 175 but forgive me as I forgotten the number (m770?). Perfect for young teems and college kids getting into music but may misplace....Given their merger with HK (along with their tremendous royalty and resources!!), an already established mid-range brand at JBL, I felt they couldn't miss. Admittedly, their noice-cancelling is truly superb and a leader. Yet, I feel their R&D placed such focus on this mastery that they forgot it's the music we care about!! Very limited range, distorted highs, and embarrassing lows.That said, it's not my nature to bash someone's work, and I'd simply suggest this headphone for someone who just needs a well-built set for traveling and little less cost. Their well-built feel and cuffs are so that your flying companion wont a hear a thing, or simply leave the music off and enjoy that you'r not hear those screaming children, Hope JBL figures it out, there's an opportunity between overpriced Beats (which have made vast improvement to sound quality but not reputation, and Magnolia-line products like Sessenhieser. Ok, I am impatient and embarraseed----I bought the TOL Beats Pro for 379 for a month until I can sell them and splurge for the Sennsenhiers coming out in Jan with supposed unheard quality....and costs =). It's an investment. For the BEATS, I have to admit they have wide hz range, gold drives, >3ohms, and clear vocals. Never thought I'd say that. I'd only recommend themto the right person. They seem durable, too. But, music deserves to be heard in its best form, sorry JBL.",3.0,320,0.22087438423645323,4,14,1,0.01043719211822658,-0.06502114075932108,-1
"Following in the prestigious heritage of the Everest line from JBL, the Elite 700 sits upon the top of its family of lifestyle consumer headphones. Though not a new type of product, in this day and a age it is still a first from JBL offering a headphone with a well-rounded feature set to ensure these will satisfy your needs in nearly all scenarios.The packaging is typical of a premium headphone offering that grand appearance once you open the flap to reveal the contents. The Elite 700s is nicely presented in a cut out. Once removed you can lift the box in which inside is where the zipper carrying pouch is located. This pouch is primarily good for scratch protection, as it does not have any reinforcements to absorb impact damage. Kind of a bummer because when spending this much on headphones you would want a case to truly protect them from everyday mishaps. Beneath the box is the one button standard 3.5 to 2.5mm auxiliary that can allow the Elite 700 to be used passively in case the battery dies. Next up is the micro USB cable to charge and/or sync the Elite 700 to a computer to update the firmware. Lastly, we have the warranty and quick start guide documentation.The comfort here is excellent for the most part with super plush ear pads that uniquely contour to the back of the ear by raising up slightly. Ear pad diameter opening is also adequate; however, the headband seems to distribute the rather heavier than average weight of the Elite 700 to small area on the top of the head causing discomfort after prolonged periods of use.On the bottom right ear cup you can find the 3.5mm input jack, the micro USB charge and sync port, as well as the built-in microphone. Turn it over and you will find the power button located on the top and the smart button, which can either toggle on and off ANC or the three levels of awareness mode located on the bottom. Moving over to the left ear cup reveals the volume up button, the play/pause, answer/hang-up phone calls and voice assistant button and the volume down button.The Elite 700 has a companion app, which can be downloaded free from the App store or Google Play store. Functionality is nice and the way to execute is straightforward and intuitive. You can quickly toggle on and off the ANC as well as configure if you want the awareness modes to activate reversing the mics to let you hear what is going on around you. It can be adjusted for ear independently or in a preset category of low, medium or high or off. You can adjust the frequencies in this EQ area by either selecting from a preset or customizing your own. Moving back, you can disable or enable the auto off feature when there is no music playing or voice prompts and configure what the smart button on the Elite 700 will trigger. Lastly, you can activate TruNote, which measures the acoustical space between the eardrum, and the speaker to ensure the response is optimal to minimize any unwanted resonance and distortionsI am just going to get straight to the point and say it. The Elite 700 is as of today my favorite overall headphone and I never expected them to be. I was merely curious from seeing their kiosk in BestBuy and having respect for JBL as a brand to care what these have to offer as well as I figured hey, I have a 30-day return window, whats there to lose? Well, these are the first Bluetooth headphones I have owned that did not make me immediately want to plug them in to hear them at their full potential. The wireless mode alone is simply excellent. The ANC does take a hit to the sound primarily in the sense of space and dynamics and resolution, but it is more than listenable and when in a noisy environment is absolutely heaven. The ANC ability of the Elite 700 is roughly close to the QC25, but not quite there. With ANC off, these sound great. Because these have a companion app to allow adjustments to the tonal balance, I really cannot say how they sound in terms of a frequency response, but in stock, they sound very neutral with a slight tilt to being warm, very slight. I will just describe the characteristics of each frequency and to start it off, the bass is tight, quick and can deliver a healthy amount of sub bass. It does run out of steam and distort when the sub bass is pushed to high levels that my V-MODA Crossfade Wireless can handle with ease, but overall the Elite 700 has a tighter and slightly more textured bass than the Crossfade Wireless. The Elite 700 conveys a midrange that is open, clean, articulated and offers a nice depth to the point where sometimes I truly cannot believe I am using a wireless headphone. No wireless headphones that I have tried has delivered this level of detail and clarity, none. Treble once again is clean and if I had to nitpick, it is not as clean and refined as say my best portables in this regard such as the Bowers & Wilkins P7 or Fidelio L2. For a wireless headphone, this is honestly quite amazing. When the Elite 700 is wired, they improve slightly immediately ranking them up there with the best portables I have heard in terms of resolution and clarity. From the stellar 15-23 hour battery life, to the nicely designed companion app to give me the ability to tune the sound the way I want to hear the music down to what seems like an exceptional design in acoustical engineering has rocketed these unsuspected headphones to the top of my recommendation list.",5.0,977,0.24921724847256768,0,28,9,0.3753913757637162,-0.18049199681455586,-1
"Wireless Bluetooth Noise cancelling headsets? Yeah. It was my unicorn. I was so excited when I first saw these. Search the net for reviews... not many. It's a Best Buy exclusive, so no other sites carry it.Read the reviews here... Most are very positive. Few negative ones. All in all, not enough to dissuade me.So I bought them.Let the disappointment begin.First, the Packaging is horrible. it's almost impossible to open the box and take everything out without at least tearing some of the paper off with all the tape. Not a huge deal... but for high cost items, I like to try to keep in intact.Next packaging problem: How to take the headphones out. Turns out there are 2 small clear plastic pieces of adhesive right over the metal on the band. Couldn't tell it was plastic to be removed until I had to force the first one out.Ok. Frustrating but, not a big deal.The ""quick start"" documentation is pretty horrible. They show you the buttons, but they don't describe what they are for.. Maybe I""m not aware of the ISO symbol for LED or for the ""Smart"" button.Finally turn them on, and they went into paring mode (white/red LED flashing). Search on my phone. Nothing. turn them off, turn them back on.. same thing. Manual doesn't describe what the various flashing lights mean (both LEDs flash white? Red LED flashes twice?) Finally I resorted to their website. Found a FAQ on how to pair with a new device (Power button for 16 seconds). YAY. IT finally pairs.I anxiously fire up my Google Play Music app to hear music. The first 5 seconds it crackles, pops, and drops out and back in. After that, they sound pretty good.. Maybe it was just that start up. Hit the next track button. Same thing. First 5 seconds are horrible, then it settles down.OK.. Maybe it's the app. You Tube. Same problem (if not worse).So, now getting annoyed. $300 headphones and all these challenges? Maybe it's other cell/wifi traffic that's interfering. So, go into airplane mode, and turn on ONLY blue tooth. Crackle crackle drop crackle.So, last ditch effort, I decided to see just how good the ANC/Ambient noise was. So... No music. Just changed settings for the ANC. The room was already reasonably quiet, but I put on the TV with talking just to see how well it filtered it out (just like a chatty plane passenger might be). Switching between the 3 levels, and turning them off, I could hear a difference in the tone quality, but between off, and max, I couldn't tell as much difference between them. Not like my Bose headphones were NOTICEABLY muted the first time I turned those on (wired, not Bluetooth).Lastly, when reaching for the ""smart"" button, I bumped the micrphone right near that button. It was a very pronounced mic pickup. If I was wearing a coat with a hood or something, it would constantly interfere..I've paired my Nexus 6P phone to multiple speakers and headphones, and never had any of these issues. Tomorrow, these go back. I would spend HOURS on the phone with support trying to address all these issues. And I'm not going to sit here and hope for a firmware update.All in all, I was very disappointed in these headphones. A friends Beats headphons (no ANC, just BT/over the ear) were much better from a refinement perspective. Hopefully over time, JBL/Harmon will improve both their documentation and their software, and their headphones. But for now, it is very much a ""first version"" type of headphones... not something that is worth $300...",1.0,601,0.010267896354852873,0,30,1,0.3051339481774264,-0.1118412568111865,-1
"I have had the JBL Everest Elite 700 for a few weeks now. I tried the Bose Soundtrue, Sony XtraBass, and Beats Studio and neither one could compare to the sound quality of the JBLs. The app works well and adds to the overall sound of the headphones. As of right now these are the best I have found available at Best Buy stores.Sound:I listen to a wide variety of music from rap to metal and everything in between. They have sounded great with every genre I have thrown at them. The bass is very clean and crisp not overpowering or drowning. The mids and highs are also excellent. The one problem I find with most headphones is the overall volume being too low. With these I find my comfortable listening level at only 1/2 the total volume instead of at full volume like the Xtra bass and Bose. The Beats were plenty loud but still did not sound as good overall. I purchased the Sony Xtra Bass because they sounded great in the store display but when I got them home it was nothing like in store. On the other hand, the store display does not do these headphones justice. They sound much better than the display units.(The sound quality does take a hit when you plug them in directly to a device but not enough to take anything away from my rating.)Bluetooth:The range is excellent. I can leave my phone in one room and move around the house from room to room completely with little to no drop off. I have not tested the distance with a clear line of sight but I'm sure it's as advertised. They only pair to one device at a time but I have not had any issues pairing with my iphone or computer.Noise Cancelling:The passive noise cancelling alone is pretty good due to the thick padding in the ear cup however, this pair of headphones has active noise cancelling which work very well. I can easily drown out the sound of the kids while they play just dance in the same room. This is my first experience with ANC so I really don't have anything to compare them to. I do not get that bluetooth/noise cancelling hum that some have referred to in their reviews.Comfort:The JBLs are very comfortable with their large ear cups and soft padding. They take a adjusting to find that perfect fit but once you find it you are good to go. I have done about four hours straight while doing homework and they have been awesome. They don't get hot and do not cause sweating either.Overall these headphones are a little on the heavy side but that by no means is enough to take away from the comfort and what these headphones can do which is produce awesome sound.",5.0,472,0.2764871794871794,0,17,1,0.36175641025641037,-0.05224334780025486,-1
"There is no way to manage the features of this headset because the app doesn't work and hasn't been fixed for months. Here's the full story: At the Best Buy store, the JBL rep bragged about all the cool features and technology included, and how you control it via an app on your phone. I purchased the headphones but upon setup I discovered that the App gets stuck with a ""Please connect headphones"" screen. I tried both bluetooth and wired connections. I cleared app data and uninstalled/reinstalled. Nothing helped. On the App Store there are over 200 1-star reviews dating back months complaining about this same issue. How can JBL leave such a major issue unresolved for months? Without the app you can't turn on noise cancelling or any of the features. JBL, you should do better than that!",1.0,139,0.26249999999999996,1,7,6,0.43124999999999997,-0.008398951782024766,-1

"I'll get right into it.PROS: Sound Isolating (Also know as Passive noise cancelling)Active Noise Cancelling (ANC)Ambient Noise - Allows you to hear a bit of background noise, a little, lot, or none at all.Comfortable - Snug FitAPP - The JBL my Headphone app has 2.7 rating on App Store...You must be thinking, is this app really that bad? Could they have failed this hard? Well, the answer is yes and no. If you know how to use the app corectly, it is very useful and improves the quality of music tenfold. Jbl doesn't make any of this crystal clear; first off, the app ONLY works for the elites, and I'm told the reflects as well, have only tried the elites with the app. Second, for the app to recognize your headphones they MUST be connected through Bluetooth. Not the aux cable. If you are wanting to utilize the app through a wired pair, then I'm not really sure why you picked up a wireless set of headphones. Also in order to connect through Bluetooth wirelessly, the aux cable cannot be plugged into the headphones. The App is 4.8 stars for me. Improves the quality of music, and people who have given 1 star rating don't understand how to use the app. CONS: So far, not many. I will, however make you as informed as possible. The Fit - Headphone comfort varies from person to person, but to me they are very comfortable and snug fit. They do press on your head a bit but I prefer it, better passive noise cancelling against background noise. Size - They are a bit big, but they do fold up, and they come with a case as well. When Wired: When the battery is dead, the headphones still work with a wire (included), the App does not work, nor the awesome features of the headset. Sound goes to mediocre. Could be better, but I rarely plug them in because of 18-20 hr. battery life. Overall, 4.8/5 starsHope my review helps you make a decision for the better.

"I was looking for a wireless over-the-ear headphone with a high quality sound rendering then I went to try a few at local Best Buy store. I tried nearly all models available in demo to find that the JBL Everest Elite 700 had the best sound to my ears. As the in store demo songs are not of my taste, they are all chosen for the bumps/beats/oohmph and the voiceless shouting singers... I used my iPod to get some decent music and the JBL was the only one to sound natural to me with no overwhelming basses and highs. The mids were average, it sounds like something is missing in the mids...The ANC is the most annoying thing in these wireless headphones as it muffles a lot the music but a good point for this model is that the ANC is not as strong as the Bose quiet (I could not cope the white noise of the Bose models) and best of all, it is possible do disable it via the JBL app or the press of the smart button once programmed.Another drawback is the weight of this thing, it is very heavy for a headphone and the ear cups are too small which brings some discomfort on the long run.I do not know if my headphone has an issue but I could notice very strong and annoying scratch noises when using the headphone outdoors with ANC on while weather was a bit windy. Disabling ANC removed the issue.The JBL app is a must, it is easy to use and most settings are available at hand: trutone setup, noise cancel, ambient awareness power and balance and the jewel... the EQ settings. 4 default settings are available: Off, Jazz, Vocal, Bass + the possibility to create our own EQ settings.The smart button can be programmed to act as ANC on/off or ambiant awareness power via the app which is very convenient.The app provides also the possibility to upgrade the firmware of the headphone via bluetooth which is convenient even though I wished JBL discarded some information about the upgrade itself (what does it fix/bring?)Regarding the pouch provided, I wished JBL gave some information as I discovered by accident that the headphone can be folded inward to fit the pouch.",4.0,378,0.19423687423687427,0,22,1,0.2028815628815629,-0.03271928114464906,-1
"Please do remember that this review is based on the use from a professional DJ and not your normal Audiophile. Now with that statement out of the way I was not very impressed with my overall purchase of the JBL Everest Elite 700 Headphones. There are some features that I did enjoy having, but there was a lot more that I was not very happy about.JBL Everest Elite 700Well start out with the positives about the JBL Everest Elite 700 headphones. The headphones them selves fit very snug on my head, but that also might very from person to person. Very comfortable to wear during a 4 to 6 hour event. They turned out to be lightweight even though they are a larger size of headphone. I really enjoyed the perfectly sculpted ear cushions. They cup the ears perfectly and block out most of the ambient sound.The JBL Everest Elite 700 features Bluetooth 4.1 and connects with ease every single time. The Bluetooth allows you to use the headphone built-in media controls on the edge of the left ear piece. JBL has also allowed use of the built-in microphones for hands free calling when paired with a mobile device like a BlackBerry, Droid, or iPhone. Now if you dont want to use or cant use the Bluetooth feature they do come with a 3.5mm jack cable.JBL Everest Elite 700 is also powered by a built in rechargeable battery that will last 15 amazing hours, so there are no worries about running out of power mid set. They charge up with the use of a micro USB port on the bottom of the right ear cup. The JBL Everest Elite 700 has built in auto off sensors to preserve that amazing 15 hour battery as well.JBL Everest Elite 700Now onward to the nitty-gritty. JBL has packed them with NXTGen Active Noise Cancelling. Its a cool feature and concept, but as for DJ use its not needed and if you get the basic JBL Everest 700 it can save you $100 USD. When spinning with this feature on I did notice the headset speakers bottoming out. This made it very annoying when trying to pick out specific sounds during a mix.I feel like the structure of the JBL Everest Elite 700 could have been a lot better. Spending $300 USD on headphones they need to feel like they will last and not snap apart when you take them on and off. JBL might have done this to gain the lightweight feel or just to save money on construction. If I used these for one tourist season outside everyday I dont for see them making it all the way through. A plastic head band is not the best possibility on such a premium headphone.JBL also has listed Smart Technology: Personalize your listening experience via the MY JBL Headphones app on the box. This app is not compatible with MANY devices and judging by the many bad app reviews it doesnt even function or work correctly. Again if a company is going to push such a high dollar product they need to get everything corrected ASAP.JBL Everest Elite 700So overall from my standing point as a professional DJ the JBL Everest Elite 700 is a massively overpriced full plastic headphone with okay sound and features.",1.0,551,0.1943176681474554,0,28,2,0.3971588340737277,-0.11197086889668217,-1
"As I travel almost weekly for work, I have plenty of opportunity to wear these out, and I can say that so far (3 months in) they are working out well. My 3rd purchase of 200+ dollar headphones, I wanted to try out the 3 major brands in competition, and these are so far the best sub 300 dollar headphones you can buy with ANC. Ive tried the best (Bose 350 dollars for like match to JBL) and the worst to find the JBL outstanding for 240+ dollars. ( bought these on sale ) The JBL headphones are comfortable, but not as light as the Bose, but still, they don't weigh down your ears or top of head after 2+ hours of use. These are well built, and are flexible for the many different sizes of heads out there. Mine is tiny, so these can look a little goofy on me, but for the average head, they will look just fine! The reason you would buy these though, would be for the Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and its price point versus Bose. At 240 dollars, these are awesome. At 300 dollars (normal price) I would say its up to the individual if they want to save for the higher priced competition. The ANC is good, but not perfect, and compared to Bose, do not cancel out all of the noise. But what I like about these are the ability to bring 2 different levels of outside noise into the headphones which is nice when your walking around the airports all day and want to avoid collisions. And while the ANC is not the best, at 240+ dollars, you really cant go wrong. The best about these? They can be updated VIA the app! Meaning that JBL can fix or update anything related to the headphones without having to physically upgrade over time. While I'm not alone on my opinion related to the ANC, (seems most tech reviews state the same thing,) I would still recommend these at the price point I paid!",4.0,342,0.22304804804804806,3,18,2,0.18847597597597598,-0.06862520953101936,-1
"I was looking for nice over the ear wireless headphones. I read tons of reviews and everything was leading me to the Bose QC35. After listening to them in the store, I was impressed with the richness of the sound, but didn't really want noise cancelling (I've got a pair of Bose in ear for that purpose and those are simply the best at blocking out unwanted sound...much better than the QC models IMHO). They didn't block out a lot of noise in the store and the noise cancelling seemed a bit overbearing. I started trying different models in the store and literally stumbled upon the JBLs. It didn't take long for me to be totally impressed with the sound quality and full richness of the sound. I was going to the the non-ANC model, but they were out of stock. This one was close in price so I splurged a bit. I'm glad I did. ANC - it's really not that useful. I does block out some ambient sound while music is playing and gives a bit more focus to the music really. Does it drown out voices or other louder noises? No. This is very minimal effect. The nice thing is that the music sounds precisely the same with it on or off. The ANC can easily be switched off while preserving the sound quality. If anything I'd say the ANC might clean up the music a bit, but it's not so processed that it changes the sound. For louder volumes, you'd be hard-pressed to tell if it's on or off. If you're looking for serious noise cancellation, this is not the one to get. The packaging is very nice and top notch. As a surprise, there is a carrying case included. Just a pouch and not hard sided, but a nice pouch that is not at all cheap looking or feeling. Kudos for that. The sound - it's great! Really great! Full and rich and not at all processed sounding. It's really nice. Deep bass, clear highs. Really can't tell that this is not plugged in as the sound is superb. Even at full volume, there is never any punch to the base, just a nice low rumble. The highs never screech, but get delivered with nice clarity. The mids and voices are clear and right where they should be. JBL did this right. The app on the phone has preset equalizer settings, or you can create your own custom profile (more than one). The bluetooth has great range and doesn't skip a beat. The battery percentage shows up near the bluetooth icon on my iPhone. It paired quickly and without any issues. I just got these a few hours ago so can't really comment on the battery life just yet. Plugged in with the included cable, the sound is exactly the same so far as I can tell. That is - as long as they are switched 'on'. When switched off, they will work, but there is a drop in quality. When a cable is plugged in, bluetooth is shut off immediately. When the cable gets unplugged, bluetooth switches back on right away and it re-connects with the phone. The size/weight is a lot. These are not small and can be a bit heavy resting on the top of your head. The padding is there but could be more to alleviate some pressure. Could just be me as I've not had over the ear headphones in a long time, but worth mentioning here. Another really nice thing is that with the app, I could update the firmware over bluetooth. I think previous models were windows pc only, but this updated easily and without a problem. Some have said that the lag when watching videos is terrible. Must have been a firmware thing because there is positively no lag at all. After just a short amount of time I'm quite impressed and happy with my purchase. Not so sure about the white color, but for some strange reason is a lot less in price over the black ones so I saved the money. At BestBuy they have a display where you can plug in your phone and listen to your own music or a pre-set playlist on the display. I HIGHLY recommend doing that and comparing the same songs or videos with multiple models. Forget these reviews as sound is highly subjective. Just don't pass these up as they really are a very nice yet may be overlooked for Beast or Bose.",5.0,755,0.2791424287518038,2,22,1,0.3604287856240981,-0.1276930107923966,-1

"Following in the prestigious heritage of the Everest line from JBL, the Elite 700 sits upon the top of its family of lifestyle consumer headphones. Though not a new type of product, in this day and a age it is still a first from JBL offering a headphone with a well-rounded feature set to ensure these will satisfy your needs in nearly all scenarios.The packaging is typical of a premium headphone offering that grand appearance once you open the flap to reveal the contents. The Elite 700’s is nicely presented in a cut out. Once removed you can lift the box in which inside is where the zipper carrying pouch is located. This pouch is primarily good for scratch protection, as it does not have any reinforcements to absorb impact damage. Kind of a bummer because when spending this much on headphones you would want a case to truly protect them from everyday mishaps. Beneath the box is the one button standard 3.5 to 2.5mm auxiliary that can allow the Elite 700 to be used passively in case the battery dies. Next up is the micro USB cable to charge and/or sync the Elite 700 to a computer to update the firmware. Lastly, we have the warranty and quick start guide documentation.The comfort here is excellent for the most part with super plush ear pads that uniquely contour to the back of the ear by raising up slightly. Ear pad diameter opening is also adequate; however, the headband seems to distribute the rather heavier than average weight of the Elite 700 to small area on the top of the head causing discomfort after prolonged periods of use.On the bottom right ear cup you can find the 3.5mm input jack, the micro USB charge and sync port, as well as the built-in microphone. Turn it over and you will find the power button located on the top and the smart button, which can either toggle on and off ANC or the three levels of awareness mode located on the bottom. Moving over to the left ear cup reveals the volume up button, the play/pause, answer/hang-up phone calls and voice assistant button and the volume down button.The Elite 700 has a companion app, which can be downloaded free from the App store or Google Play store. Functionality is nice and the way to execute is straightforward and intuitive. You can quickly toggle on and off the ANC as well as configure if you want the awareness modes to activate reversing the mics to let you hear what is going on around you. It can be adjusted for ear independently or in a preset category of low, medium or high or off. You can adjust the frequencies in this EQ area by either selecting from a preset or customizing your own. Moving back, you can disable or enable the auto off feature when there is no music playing or voice prompts and configure what the smart button on the Elite 700 will trigger. Lastly, you can activate TruNote, which measures the acoustical space between the eardrum, and the speaker to ensure the response is optimal to minimize any unwanted resonance and distortionsI am just going to get straight to the point and say it. The Elite 700 is as of today my favorite overall headphone and I never expected them to be. I was merely curious from seeing their kiosk in BestBuy and having respect for JBL as a brand to care what these have to offer as well as I figured “hey, I have a 30-day return window, what’s there to lose?” Well, these are the first Bluetooth headphones I have owned that did not make me immediately want to plug them in to hear them at their full potential. The wireless mode alone is simply excellent. The ANC does take a hit to the sound primarily in the sense of space and dynamics and resolution, but it is more than listenable and when in a noisy environment is absolutely heaven. The ANC ability of the Elite 700 is roughly close to the QC25, but not quite there. With ANC off, these sound great. Because these have a companion app to allow adjustments to the tonal balance, I really cannot say how they sound in terms of a frequency response, but in stock, they sound very neutral with a slight tilt to being warm, very slight. I will just describe the characteristics of each frequency and to start it off, the bass is tight, quick and can deliver a healthy amount of sub bass. It does run out of steam and distort when the sub bass is pushed to high levels that my V-MODA Crossfade Wireless can handle with ease, but overall the Elite 700 has a tighter and slightly more textured bass than the Crossfade Wireless. The Elite 700 conveys a midrange that is open, clean, articulated and offers a nice depth to the point where sometimes I truly cannot believe I am using a wireless headphone. No wireless headphones that I have tried has delivered this level of detail and clarity, none. Treble once again is clean and if I had to nitpick, it is not as clean and refined as say my best portables in this regard such as the Bowers & Wilkins P7 or Fidelio L2. For a wireless headphone, this is honestly quite amazing. When the Elite 700 is wired, they improve slightly immediately ranking them up there with the best portables I have heard in terms of resolution and clarity. From the stellar 15-23 hour battery life, to the nicely designed companion app to give me the ability to tune the sound the way I want to hear the music down to what seems like an exceptional design in acoustical engineering has rocketed these unsuspected headphones to the top of my recommendation list.",5.0,977,0.24921724847256768,0,28,9,0.3753913757637162,-0.18049199681455586,-1

These are not a great option for a common listener, as you likely want to just throw the on, connect, and go.",3.0,940,0.14147580612533886,0,19,3,0.029262096937330506,-0.14288165939711095,-1
"Please do remember that this review is based on the use from a professional DJ and not your normal “Audiophile”. Now with that statement out of the way I was not very impressed with my overall purchase of the JBL® Everest™ Elite 700 Headphones. There are some features that I did enjoy having, but there was a lot more that I was not very happy about.JBL® Everest™ Elite 700We’ll start out with the positives about the JBL® Everest™ Elite 700 headphones. The headphones them selves fit very snug on my head, but that also might very from person to person. Very comfortable to wear during a 4 to 6 hour event. They turned out to be lightweight even though they are a larger size of headphone. I really enjoyed the perfectly sculpted ear cushions. They cup the ears perfectly and block out most of the ambient sound.The JBL® Everest™ Elite 700 features Bluetooth 4.1 and connects with ease every single time. The Bluetooth allows you to use the headphone built-in media controls on the edge of the left ear piece. JBL® has also allowed use of the built-in microphones for hands free calling when paired with a mobile device like a BlackBerry, Droid, or iPhone. Now if you don’t want to use or can’t use the Bluetooth feature they do come with a 3.5mm jack cable.JBL® Everest™ Elite 700 is also powered by a built in rechargeable battery that will last 15 amazing hours, so there are no worries about running out of power mid set. They charge up with the use of a micro USB port on the bottom of the right ear cup. The JBL® Everest™ Elite 700 has built in auto off sensors to preserve that amazing 15 hour battery as well.JBL® Everest™ Elite 700Now onward to the nitty-gritty. JBL® has packed them with NXTGen Active Noise Cancelling. It’s a cool feature and concept, but as for DJ use it’s not needed and if you get the basic JBL® Everest™ 700 it can save you $100 USD. When spinning with this feature on I did notice the headset speakers bottoming out. This made it very annoying when trying to pick out specific sounds during a mix.I feel like the structure of the JBL® Everest™ Elite 700 could have been a lot better. Spending $300 USD on headphones they need to feel like they will last and not snap apart when you take them on and off. JBL® might have done this to gain the lightweight feel or just to save money on construction. If I used these for one tourist season outside everyday I don’t for see them making it all the way through. A plastic head band is not the best possibility on such a premium headphone.JBL® also has listed “Smart Technology: Personalize your listening experience via the MY JBL Headphones app” on the box. This app is not compatible with MANY devices and judging by the many bad app reviews it doesn’t even function or work correctly. Again if a company is going to push such a high dollar product they need to get everything corrected ASAP.JBL® Everest™ Elite 700So overall from my standing point as a professional DJ the JBL® Everest™ Elite 700 is a massively overpriced full plastic headphone with okay sound and features.",1.0,551,0.1943176681474554,0,28,2,0.3971588340737277,-0.11197086889668217,-1
"As I travel almost weekly for work, I have plenty of opportunity to wear these out, and I can say that so far (3 months in) they are working out well. My 3rd purchase of 200+ dollar headphones, I wanted to try out the 3 major brands in competition, and these are so far the best sub 300 dollar headphones you can buy with ANC. Ive tried the best (Bose 350 dollars for like match to JBL) and the worst to find the JBL outstanding for 240+ dollars. ( bought these on sale )  The JBL headphones are comfortable, but not as light as the Bose, but still, they don't weigh down your ears or top of head after 2+ hours of use. These are well built, and are flexible for the many different sizes of heads out there. Mine is tiny, so these can look a little goofy on me, but for the average head, they will look just fine! The reason you would buy these though, would be for the Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and its price point versus Bose. At 240 dollars, these are awesome. At 300 dollars (normal price) I would say its up to the individual if they want to save for the higher priced competition. The ANC is good, but not perfect, and compared to Bose, do not cancel out all of the noise. But what I like about these are the ability to bring 2 different levels of outside noise into the headphones which is nice when your walking around the airports all day and want to avoid collisions. And while the ANC is not the best, at 240+ dollars, you really cant go wrong. The best about these? They can be updated VIA the app! Meaning that JBL can fix or update anything related to the headphones without having to physically upgrade over time. While I'm not alone on my opinion related to the ANC, (seems most tech reviews state the same thing,) I would still recommend these at the price point I paid!",4.0,342,0.22304804804804806,3,18,2,0.18847597597597598,-0.06862520953101936,-1

"Unlike all the good reviews I read before purchasing this, my experience has been quite the opposite & I am very, very disappointed. I think it took about 3 or 4 hours to fully charge the battery pack when I first got it, & it would then charge my Galaxy 4 phone in about 2 hours or so, but then the battery pack is done. After charging my phone fully, the battery pack drains quite fast when not in use. I started to recharge my phone tonight & although it charged at first, I noticed my phone suddenly began losing the charge. I figured that the battery pack had drained while in the drawer, so I plugged it in to charge it, & after 1 hour, the battery pack still had a red light on, felt quite hot, & the charger at the point where it is plugged into the wall, was so hot it alarmed me, something that had never happened when charging my phone. I immediately removed it, with the red light on the battery pack still on, & decided to see if I could see just where things stood. I plugged my phone into it & saw a temporary green light. Then nothing. My phone is charging slowly but who knows what will happen next. Some are saying they've gone on day long adventures, away from local plug in availability, & had no problem losing power to their devices. I'm in my own home & can only get 1 charge on 1 occasion, & a burning hot charger on another occasion. This device is absolutely serving no purpose whatsoever, as I can charge my phone on the charger that it came with. If this thing won't hold it's own charge, unused, for more than a couple hours, what's the point? Totally useless in an emergency. What a waste of money. And it's too late to return it. So I'm stuck with a piece of junk & am out $43. It was on sale for $40....now the sale price is down to $30. Piece of junk.....maybe just a lemon, but this is very discouraging & I have to say don't bother. Also, be sure to test repeatedly, on different levels of service, from the very beginning so you can return if it isn't going to last. I've got my eye on another one, more expensive but hopefully better quality. Just waiting for it to go on sale. Next time, I'm not going to go with blind trust....I'll test it every which was but loose starting immediately, & return it if it doesn't live up.

"First let me say I bought my Harmony Ultimate One from Dell, not Amazon. I had been using a harmony remote with fewer functions and really liked it.But I've had so much trouble with this one. This remote has a feature that you press if the remote didn't carry out all the steps you asked it to perform. For instance, if you want to watch roku, the remote is supposed to turn on the television and sound bar and change the television HDMI to the one that Roku is on. I'd say 6 out of 10 times, I've had to ask Harmony to fix it. Eventually, it does fix it, but as often as not, it takes several attempts. About 50 of the time, the off button doesn't work. And finally, there's not much life to the battery.....and that's been true from the get-go.

"LOGITECH DOES NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS...DONT BUY LOGITECH.. after buying 4 remotes and two diNovo keyboards ( so I was a good repeat customer) I bought a refurbished harmony 900 direct from the Logitech website. after getting the remote when I went to use it and called customer support they said I was out of my 90 day support window. I said no way, I just bought this. They had an in service date that was the original in service date of the first guy who bought the remote and in the company system had it been registered as defective. phone support would not help me. when I tried to connect the remote through the web app a message said this remote was returned as defective and has been disabled. Then when I called back they wanted me to buy a support call to talk further! They stole my money by selling me an unusable nonworking defective device and then the customer service was so lame that the call center guys could do nothing. several emails to the company have gone unanswered. I will never buy another Logitech device until/unless they respond to me and stand behind their device.

"My first Harmony remote did not survive a drop on the floor. The second one died when the cat knocked it on the floor. I was dismayed when I learned that the old model was no longer available and at the price of the new one. I was also a bit taken aback by the negative comments of some reviewers regarding the Harmony Ultimate One. I am pleased to report that after using the new model for a few weeks, my fears were groundless. My old system setup transferred to the new device using the online programming with only a moderate amount of confusion and hair pulling. I find the new display empowering. Several of the buttons are not in what I would consider the optimal locations but I don't find that to be a major problem. Overall, I'm very happy with this unit.There was also some confusion on my part about some kind of ultimate hub device. It does NOT come with the Ultimate One package that I purchased nor was it needed to control my devices. I'm still not clear on what it is, but that doesn't matter as I don't need it.Oh yes, this time we built a little wooden box with an open top in which to house the controller and its charger base (and also a portable telephone and charger base). The cat will have a hard time damaging THIS controller! On the down side, I recently bought a cordless mouse and this morning I had to hunt to find where the cat left it.

"BLUF: Great remote and would buy againThis is a replacement for a Harmony 700 (discontinued) that was beginning to fail and this was a great upgrade.For background, I have been using and programming various remotes for years going back to older Philips Pronto remotes- This is a very intuitive and powerful platform in a reasonably priced package! Coming from another Harmony remote, the initial setup was very simple with a few tweaks for preference and new capability. I say that acknowledging I am something of a geek and understand the basics of how remotes work and their limitations. Even for the technologically challenged, Logitech has done a good job of making the programming interface intuitive and easy to use but still powerful enough for advanced users to customize. If anything, it errors on the side of simplicity vice functionality.Some of the biggest concerns I had was the fast-forward/skip button since the two functions have been combined into a single button with this remote. I was quite leery of this as a DirecTV customer but happy to report that with a bit of tweaking and use of the gestures this is completely a non-issue. Only shortfall I can complain about is the lack of immediate access to the number pad- you can swipe left/right to it but I would prefer to map a soft key to bring it up. Niggling issue that may be possible but I haven't found an easy way to do it just yet.The biggest complaint and the area where Logitech misses the mark is (as others have pointed out) with the basic ergonomics. The hard buttons are great, the touch screen is great and the overall size of the remote is great, they just need to re-organize! Put the touchscreen at the very top and move the transport controls (FF, pause, record, play etc.) under the screen! It would even benefit from being slightly longer to allow the main controls to sit just above center (where your thumb naturally sits) and fit better in the hand. I complain about this, pointing out this is a great unit that could benefit from a refresh- same functionality in a slightly different package.To wrap this up, I am VERY pleased with this remote overall. It is not perfect and could use a change to the basic layout BUT it is a SOLID unit that is very flexible and a pleasure to use. If you are considering this a a first universal remote or an upgrade to an existing one, it is well worth it.",4.0,424,0.1619763005356226,3,15,1,0.2190118497321888,-0.08415971218266649,-1
"This is the most user hostile product I have ever purchased, EVER! Just when you sit down to watch your favorite show, the remote stops working you have to sync the remote or install yet another firmware update. Sometimes this requires you to connect the remote to your computer which must be in the same room as the hub. This takes several minutes. After the updates, you will have to go through rearrange all your screens the way you had them before which is a pain in the butt when all you wanted to do was sit down to relax watch some TV.After only 18 months, our remote would only show the Harmony logo would not go any further.

"Compared to all of the other Logitech Products I have owned, including numerous mice, keyboards, and three Harmony Ones, the Ultimate One performs surprisingly poorly with regard to its programming software.Maybe once I get it working it will work OK, but that will never excuse the following: 1) Would not work on a Win 7 64 bit Home Premium computer, failed with multiple download errors (Unexpected or Unknown error/ try again) downloading the Harmony app and attempting to install without downloading the harmony app 2) Would not work on a Win 7 32 bit Ultimate computer, failed with the same multiple download errors downloading the Harmony app and attempting to install without downloading the harmony app 3) Finally installed on a Win 8.1 computer, retrieved my info from previous Harmony One (or did I, can't confirm this, none of the supposedly retrieved settings are ones I have used in several years) yet failed to retrieve settings for watching TV or Bluray, e.g, my DirecTV One or DirecTV Two receivers (e.g., Watch TV) or Bluray activities (Sony Bluray) (which of course are the primary activities for which I purchased remote).For 250 after 2 hours with basically no progress to me that is worse than useless, I have wasted precious family time without any satisfaction for which I purchased remote, I seek products that work as advertised without unsolvable complications (e.g., unexpected error, unknown error, no tech support available, no Google threads regarding error messages, implicit solution: buy/try another computer). If I were a teenager this conundrum might be interesting, but as it is, I do not have lots of spare time to tinker with problems caused by engineers who release products that are not ready for prime time. Oh and by the way Logitech keeps more or less banker's hours, i.e., Monday through Friday 8 to 5 so forget about tech support unless you don't have a job.By way of comparison, it used to take me 20 minutes to program the Harmony One, with the Ultimate One and 2 hours into the project, all I can control is the volume on the AV amplifier.Wish I had never had reason to make an acquaintance with Ultimate One, unless you have lots of time to kill I recommend that you avoid it and wait for next iteration of Harmony remote, or seek alternative company's remote if available.As piece of hardware, the Ultimate One may have promise. If I get out of the woods with the software, I will post the results.Addendum: 04/19/14: OK, now that the remote is programmed, I love this remote! Overall I prefer Logitech products (e.g., Razer mouse, K400 illuminated wireless keyboard, Squeezebox Touch, Harmony One), no design is perfect given that compromises are always necessary, but I tend to prefer their solutions, so I have high expectations. As for the Harmony Ultimate, I like the form factor including the decreased size from the One (perhaps the DVR buttons should be on the bottom but it does not bother me as it does others) and the flexibility and power of the programming is a definite leap forward. I haven't yet tried the onscreen leap forward/jump back buttons, but if I don't like them, I can always program two of the colored buttons at the bottom to perform those functions. For me it was not that hard to program, I just needed to take a break after all the initial frustration when the software would not install.If it were not for the install glitches I would give the Ultimate One a 5 out of 5 stars. As my experience got off to such a rocky start and others may not own computers with a variety of Operating Systems in order to troubleshoot MyHarmony software install issues (and lack of evening/weekend technical support) 4 stars is is as high as I can go.I believe seamless compatibility with Win7 should be a given, although I suppose you could try and blame Windows, but for a company as widespread as Logitech it seems they should be able to do a lot better. FWIW the Win8.1 computer is not my favorite, but I purchased it a year after Win 8 was released in order to attempt to keep up with the times, and this is the second occasion it has come in handy i.e., when my daughter had to do violin tests for public middle school orchestra, the Smart Music app failed with an incomprehensible error, same problem with only daytime M-F tech support, and no searchable threads to explore any solutions. So we installed SmartMusic on the new all in one portable Win 8.1 Dell and never looked back, problem solved.10/12/14 Still mostly love this remote, my vote remains 4 1/2 stars.In case it hasn't already been answered via other threads, the DirecTV jump forward/back button functions (approx 30 sec forward, 7 seconds back, if memory serves) do still exist on this remote but they are indeed hidden by an Android-style tap versus press/hold gesture, i.e., tapping the FF or RW button brings up the fast forward/rewind functions, e.g., 1-4 taps equals 1-4 times speed for FF/RW, whereas press/hold brings up the jump forward/back functions (with a vibrate signal to indicate success in accessing the press/hold feature, so you know when to let go, found these functions by accident one day when I pressed and held the buttons a bit too long, one second I suppose).My only real gripe with this remote now is that occasionally I press the power off button when I am trying to press the rewind button it would be nice if the power button was a bit more physically isolated from the RW button if you don't watch TV every day sometimes your tactile grasp of where the buttons are on the remote is less secure, and you really don't need to power off without having to look at the remote.Bottom line and in contradiction of other reviews regarding the tactile layout of the remote: it is still excellent without need for visual guidance once you learn the layout and compares well to that of the Harmony One (really, who needs physical number buttons when you're watching DVR) and easy to operate, even if you are working out on an elliptical machine while watching TV, I might add.",4.0,1049,0.10323036776307806,1,49,63,0.24838481611846097,-0.2383171536504579,-1
"If you are familiar with the harmony web-based setup, then setup is a breeze. I also have a Harmony Touch, so the setup was painless for me. I recall the Touch took about 20 min the first time, and subsequent trips to the setup for new devices or channel favorites was a snap.The screen interface difference with this unit, to me, is cleaner now. It is less cluttered than my Touch.Since I had the Touch setup, when I logged in to My Harmony, it asked me if I wanted to transfer the settings to the Ultimate One...well yes I do, thank you very much. Boom, just like that all my devices were set up. However, we just got an AppleTV, and as one might guess, it was a breeze to set that up too.For those that don't know, you enter your devices on the website, then create activites based on them. For example you have a tuner, a TV, a cable box, a game console, a Bluray player, and an AppleTV: for Watch TV:, you use the TV, the tuner, and the cable box. You let the Harmony know the HDMI (or other input) on the TV, that the tuner gets switched to cable/sat. Then the activity becomes, turn on the TV and make sure it is switched to the proper input, turn on the tuner and switch it to the proper output, and turn on the cable box. When you hit the off button all get turned off. Say while watching tv you want to watch a movie. Then the cable box gets turned off, the Bluray player gets turned on and the tuner switches its output mode to Blu ray/DVD. Same for gaming, radio, etc.After the unit is programmed your remote situation goes to a single remote and touch-screen goodness.My woman loves them. One remote, so no clutter. She wants to watch TV, she touches watch tv, then goes to our favorites to tap an icon of the channel's logo. It is quick an painless to bring up the soft number pad for change the channel manually.Most major functions of all devices are on the remote. I still need to get the device remotes out for things like firmware updates, or specialized functions, or to run specific apps like netflix. But for the day to day...one remote does it all and that is fantastic.",4.0,396,0.05416406926406927,0,14,1,0.2729179653679654,-0.03083147501629624,-1
"Are they there yet Nope. Still a pretty big a bite to setup, that has not changed much since I first started using the Harmony One eight or nine years ago and still use it. That model, I have no idea why it still works. It has been dropped, stepped on, kicked across the floor, my dog chewed on it, and it has came apart at the seams. I snap and bend it back into place and it still works. That is just amazing to me. Now to the remote at hand. Harmony Ultimate One IR.Ok what that means is that this is the version that does not have the remote hub that allows you to use the radio frequency to control tech in the next room, though walls. or in cabinets. You can get the remote hub separately here on Amazon, and I will be getting that because I am so tired at looking at all the receivers, players, and crap, I just can't stand it any longer. I want a clean look. Invisible tech.The Harmony Ultimate can control up to 15 devices, and Logitech has a library of nearly a quarter million different home entertainment products and their respective infrared commands. Even if your HDTV or Blu-ray player is obscure, you'll probably be able to control it with this remote.The downside on the buttons is that it has nothing to do with previous versions of Harmony Remotes so now you have to relearn the pattern you were used to. If you are first time Harmony customer no big deal. The only thing I have heard if you get the hub and I have personally not experienced this is that the hub may need to be reset from time to time.You control all your devices with one remote now and be able to make totally customizable control layouts and multi-device macros, then this Harmony One Ultimate will bend to your will. You just need a bit of patience and determination, plus a touch of imagination to turn this remote into anything you need a remote to be. It may take you some time to sit down and put all the entries in. Heck this thing can even control lighting and window blinds if thats your thing.In the end, I love touch screens. It makes everything so much more like your phone. And if you get the hub you can control your tech programed into the Harmony Ultimate from your phone with the downloadable app.Pain in the butt to program, great user experience if you have the patience and tenacity to put in what you need to control. Is that easy NO. If you have trouble doing technical things let your kid do it for you. Or find a twelve year old and bet them ten bucks they can't program it.Mission accomplished. If you have read these reviews on Amazon look into the negative reviews and you will most likely see that a logitech representative is reaching out to the reviewer to help them with a direct email or phone link. I like to see this from companiesUPDATE 6/10/14. I find the right Chanel toggle and left volume toggle too low on the remote for comfortable use. The remote is already shorter than the Harmony One, so that part is not ergonomic at all. Remote should be longer or they should have moved the toggles higher on remote.",3.0,568,0.0678424456202234,0,14,1,0.0660787771898883,-0.06865896639996616,-1
"I paid over 160 for this piece of equipment that was supposed to make my life easier. It did nothing of the kind. I like many other of the reviews that I have read here have owned many Logitech remote controls in the past. They were simple they were easy to program and they were fuss-free. This unit has none of those attributes.When I receive this unit I immediately log on to the Logitech site and put the model numbers for my television, Soundbar and surround sound comma Blu-ray player and the sinking went without incident and I started using the new remote control. I started noticing deficiencies. It would raise and lower the volume on my soundbar but could not mute it. You could not skip 30 seconds at a time while watching the DVR as my Genie remote could do. You could not use any of the smart TV attributes of my Samsung 8000 series television. So today I called and was promised by a mr. Wang that at the end of his interminable message he would give me his Direct email address so that I can address any issues with him. Of course that never happened. During the 40 minutes that I waited on hold every one minute I would get a message telling me that I should go to their Community boards or to their website has all the information I would ever need would be there. Finally I got somebody on the phone he assured me that he would be able to fix my problem without any issues. So I followed his instructions and wasted another half hour of my life. Once the think was completed he asked me to press the activity watch TV. Instead my TV went off my Blu-ray player came on my soundbar became very loud and my genie DVR was shut off even though it is set up never to go off by the Logitech programming. At that point I think the gentleman for his help and explain to him that I will be typing a complain on my Logitech keyboard to Amazon using my Logitech mouse. I also explained that these would be the last Logitech products I would ever buy. He suggested that I consider buying their new 299 super duper remote control. I am declining his offer. There are better universal remote controls for a lot cheaper than this. Stay away from this unit.",2.0,407,0.12469280719280719,0,26,1,0.16234640359640362,-0.07347613585813129,-1
"I want to love this remote, but I just can't. We got this for a great price and I debated on keeping it or not and finally decided to keep it. It is OK, but not near as good as the Harmony One in my opinion. The touch screen is a great idea, but really easy to hit things that you do not want to because it is right in the middle of the remote. I think it would have made more sense to put it at the top and have all the fixed buttons at the bottom like the Harmony One and then you would not have to reach over the touch screen to get to some frequently used buttons and accidentally hit the touchscreen. The layout of the buttons also does not seem as intuitive as older harmony remotes in my opinion and maybe that is more because I am used to the older layouts. Maybe if you are new to Harmony with this remote it would not be as big of a deal or noticeable for you.I also do not like that the bottom of the remote is curved so that it will rock from side to side with only a slight touch or movement when on a table or TV tray. I think it only hit the deck once so far and it did not cause any damage, but it is a significant concern (with hard floors) when you have a remote this expensive. All the other Harmony remotes that i have had did not have this issue (One, 880, 670). It may be of no concern if you have plush carpeted floors.I did like that the newer harmony software would automatically have all the channels available to pick favorites and it puts the icon for network on the touch screen. This was pretty slick and in older remotes there was no easy way to do this.I also do like that the charger puts the remote vertical and takes up a much smaller footprint. It is also much easier to see if the remote is in the charge from across the room. The thing i do not like, is I feel the battery life is much lower than either the Harmony One or the 880 (both discontinued). I have to charge it much more often.",3.0,389,0.14140491291654086,0,10,1,0.02929754354172953,-0.010934982296484264,-1
"frankly, after having this 10 days and getting used to it i am utterly amazed. i transferred all my settings into it from my old 650 in minutes, which sure made things a lot quicker. after all these years they were still there, but it is a very good thing i had not forgotten that 7 year old, defunct e-mail address! i pressed the Watch TV activity, and my Sony HDTV, Onkyo receiver, Dish Hopper DVR, and Pinnacle subwoofer (i built an IR switch for it), all clicked on. it feels great in your hand and is lighter, and i like the felt-like, rough surface of the back. however i can't lay it on the chair arm face down to keep it from slipping off: there aren't enuf buttons to grip it (which ironically is good), and sometimes it will erroneously trigger the touch screen: a very minor problem, but it is less likely to damage itself falling on the carpet since it doesn't weigh much. i'd give it 5 stars, but i do not find the favorite channel screen useful. the icons are too small to see well w/o my reading glasses. i'd rather just go to my guide grid on the Dish Hopper and select the channels there, where i can see what is actually on. and it is difficult to scroll up and down w/o selecting the wrong channel by mistake. for that matter, that is a problem in selecting functions on the devices too. (it takes just the right touch.) however, i just love the gesture screen controlled by swipes taps. i wish it had the ability to be controlled by two fingers also, so i had 22 instead of 11 gestures, but the screen is a bit cramped for that (and it requires the hub and a smartphone which is overkill for my purposes), i reprogrammed 4 of the 11 (and use the buttons instead), several of which control the input of my PC in the bedroom (making this old Sony HDTV semi-smart w/ a wireless keyboard and mouse).the adjustable vibration feedback when you complete a command is simply splendid. there are also about 10 different screen backgrounds to choose from. you can even upload a pic when it is plugged into the computer and create one's own wallpaper/backgrounds.my major gripe about these Logitech remotes ( remotes in general), and i have had two before this one, is the buttons wear out, before the electronics, and they will not sell the keypad. i am a retired electronics technician, so i am capable of prying apart the old 650 and replacing it. (a classic example of planned obsolescence.) this is part of the reason i went the extra mile and got this and i am happy i did. (of course the main button that went bad controlled the Dish, and was one of the four around the little screen that are not mappable, so i could not transfer it to another.) this model is tight as a clam, and they claim the rechargeable lithium battery should never need replacing. well, it may last longer than i do, but all batteries eventually need replacing. the little stand that it recharges in, either by micro USB, or AC/DC voltage converter w/ micro USB is great. in no time one gets into the habit of putting it back in the stand, so one is less likely to misplace it, and it doesn't take very long to recharge. the 650 ate batteries for breakfast!this was refurbished/recertified, and came w/ a QC sticker on it. i got it elsewhere, and it looks and functions brand new. Logitech handles it w/ a warranty like it is a brand new one, and i don't think i am imagining this: their customer/tech service seems to have improved from what i remember. 80+ is a bargain, when one considers the retail price of a new one. this was refurbished/recertified, came w/ a QC sticker on it, and i obtained it elsewhere. it looks and functions as if brand new, off the shelf.

"I've had a love/hate relationship with Harmony for the past 10 years...but no more second chances.Just like every Harmony I've ever owned, setup for this required a call to tech support. I'm fairly tech savvy, and this should be easy to set up, but it wasn't. And I know it wasn't me because it took tech support 30+ minutes and 7 syncs to make it function properly. Yes, properly is in quotes because even at its best, it was unimpressive.On my own using the software, syncing failed to load my activities into the remote. And again...it took tech support 7 syncs to make it work.Even after it was working properly, it was still frustrating to use:1) When switching between TV and SMART TV, it would power the speaker bar on and off. Does Logitech not understand that TV and SMART TV are not 2 separate devices and if you are switching from one to the other the sound should be left on With a remote this expensive I shouldn't have to dig out the speaker bar remote to turn it back on every time I switch activities.2) Lack of physical buttons for numbers is annoying. Any time I need the number pad I have to swipe to unlock, then swipe to get to the number pad. Technology is supposed to make processes faster...not slower. And yes, I know I can turn off the lock feature...but then every time I grab the remote it does something I don't want, and that something usually requires time-consuming troubleshooting.3) As I mentioned before, programming this remote is a nightmare (2+ hours) and even then it couldn't stand alone. I ran into problems only tech support could solve, and even then it took 30 minutes AFTER I had all the correct devices loaded. Please note that this was a simple configuration: Sony smart TV/Fios DVR/Samsung speaker bar. All less than 3 years old. After I returned this remote I bought a learning remote and endured programming every single button individually, and it still took a fraction of the time.4) There is no POWER button. Only an OFF button. You turn things on by selecting an activity. And as stated before...switching to a new activity powers things off that a remote this expensive should understand should be left on. If you are going to have a single OFF button that powers down everything with an activity button that turns everything back on, you should have an ON button for each device so you can quickly turn on any device that for whatever reason doesn't turn on when you fire up the system with an ACTIVITY button. And again...having to do an initial swipe to get to the ACTIVITIES just to turn the system on is annoying. Why does Logitech insist on writing code that slows down the power-on process5) You cannot utilize the Harmony software without plugging in the device. Why When things aren't working correctly (which is often) we should be able to fire up the app just to review the settings. Then, when you do plug the remote in, you have to wait for the remote and your PC to establish communication. Don't software engineers understand that we HATE waiting for technology to do things Especially when forced to plug in when we don't want to Speaking of plugging in, it is difficult with this remote. First off, there is a totally unnecessary door. That door gets in the way when you're trying to plug in, and plugging in is difficult enough already because the mini-USB port is deeply recessed inside the door. Do we really need to cause all this hassle just to hide a mini-USB port C'mon Logitech...don't you guys own cell phones Mini-USB doors are annoying and useless (which is why cell phones stopped using them). Try to keep up.6) Tech support is only good for 90 days. Based on my experience with this remote and 2 previous Harmony remotes, this means that any changes I make to my very simple home entertainment system will not work, and I will not be able to get help to make them work.A remote that costs well over 100 should assimilate my entertainment system like the Borg. It should be simple to set up, function extremely quickly/efficiently, and be highly intuitive. This device is just another example of technology that steals away hours of your your life that you will never get back.",1.0,739,-0.041202817650186074,0,31,1,0.27939859117490695,-0.1326182019810873,-1

"I was a little nervous about buying this remote given several negative reviews. I'm very glad I found the courage to buy it because it is, without question, the best remote I have ever owned. I wanted to control the following devices:* Sony KDL-46HX850 TV* Sony BDP-S570 Blu-ray player* Sony STR-DN2010 surround amp* Apple TV (3rd Gen)* ATT STB - Motorola VIP-1200* Bang Olufsen Beocenter 2300* Lutron Light - MIR 600THW* Dyson AM05 - Hot and cold fanIt took about an hour or so playing with it (which was fun in itself) to learn how to configure the remote as I wanted it. I now have it exactly as I could have ever hoped for. I have it configured for the following activities:* Watch ATT U-verse* Watch Apple TV* Watch Blu-ray* Listen to BO* Turn on/off and adjust lights* Turn on/off and adjust Dyson fanMoving from one activity to another is as simple as it gets and remote powers down all devices that were in use by the previous activity (when appropriate to do so). The vibration feedback deals with any concerns I had about using the remote without directly looking at it. Picking up the remote switches on the color screen, which switches off shortly after the remote is put down. The remote feels really good in the hand and it is very clear that Logitech put a lot of effort into the ergonomics of the unit.On the negative side, the laptop software appears buggy. I use a Macbook Air with Yosemite and I had to reboot both the Mac and the remote several times as I went through the learning and configuration process. Some work here for Logitech.All in all this is an excellent product. That I can now box up 5 other remote controls is a dream come true.",5.0,302,0.07332561728395061,0,27,1,0.46333719135802465,-0.07538737116436312,-1
"I am a long time Logitech Harmony remote customer. Their products are not perfect and I have had some sort of reliability issue with everyone I have purchased but have stayed with them because there is nothing else on the market that is as easy for a DIY to program and set up. This remote works great, easy to use and the simplest for me to set up. It imported all of my settings from my 880 and I only had to make one minor adjustment and were good to go!

"Honestly, this remote is pretty great. Some argue about how the play/pause buttons are at the top but I had no issue using it that way. Besides, most of what I tried let's me use the Ok and directional buttons as play/pause, fastforward/rewind. The touch screen is pretty responsive and there isn't much delay accessing your devices or activities. What sucks is that there is a limitation of 15 device no matter if you add more of these remotes or add a hub, you'll get the maximum amount from the device that has the maximum limit. I wish the 8 device limit from my harmony hub combined with this harmony remote giving me a total of 23 devices. But nope Logitech just wants you to buy one of the expensive remotes to have the 15 limit. Even the Elite has a maximum of 15. So the maximum you could get from the most expensive remote is also 15. They should have at least doubled that as they did with the 8 limits.Before I begin, I would like to say this is my first time owning a smart universal remote. I had one or two or so cheap universal remotes before. So this is a bigger difference.Battery: Charge it for four hours. Use it for about 72 hours. Plenty of time to use this imo. Just leave it on charge when you sleep and you'll be good to go throughout the day. It has a charging indicator on the screen that let's you know when charging and fully charged. There is a battery life indicator on the top right of the screen when the remote is out of lock screen. You can charge this two ways. It has a cradle but you can also use the micro USB port below the remote to charge it up. (The micro USB port is mostly just there to setup the remote through PC but you can charge it through micro USB port as well.)Design: The remote looks beauitful. Though, it could have been better. I do agree with people that the play/pause, fastforward/rewind buttons should have been at the bottom. But honestly that isn't an issue as most of the stuff I've tried lets you use the directional and ok button as play/pause, fastforward/rewind. But either way it's pretty easy to use and feels nice in the hands. I love having a remote that has both a touchscreen and physical buttons. Touchscreen adds more functionality and having physical buttons just feels better pressing on them. Number keys would have been nice but really not needed if you have ditched cable and don't plan on having an antenna. And it doesn't take much effort looking at the touchscreen when entering the numbers. I know some people don't like that but at least it's just 9 numbers and not an entire alphabet. :)Interface: Not much could be done with an interface when the screen is small. It's nice for a universal remote (much better than what smart universal remotes had before). You can change the background from a preset or upload your own through the computer. Overall, it's pretty easy to use and really no delay from going device to device.Touch screen: Like I mentioned before, the touch screen is pretty responsive. If you don't want to accidentally touch the touch screen, it's best to put the lock screen. So you can just swipe the lock screen when you want to use it and you don't accidentally end up pressing any of the touchscreen buttons when you meant to touch the physical buttons etc.Customization: You can arrange the order of devices. For example if you want TV all the way at top you can drag it to all the way at the top when you are in edit mode. Same with activities. What you can't arrange is Smart Home devices that are in the Plug/Lights folders. You can arrange where Plugs and Lights go but not the devices themselves in the Plugs and Lights folder. Kinda sucks as you can do that with the Harmony app but not on the remote. Also, the arrangement you set in the Harmony app doesn't get applied to the remote. You have to do the arrangement separately on both the app and remote. Also as I said before you can also change the background image to a selection from the preset or upload your own through the computer. Customization is great but could be better. At least it's there. :)Activities/Favorites: You setup activities which lets you can turn on multiple things at once. You can also for example access your favorite channels or if you have a Roku your favorite apps. It seems like there is only integration with Roku when it comes to Alexa and Favorites section. So for example you can launch Netflix from the Netflix icon in the favorite sections once you hit the Roku activity.Limitations: It kind of sucks that there is a device limitation of 15 devices only. I'm sure they could have gone with a much higher limit. I have a IR+RF Hub called Broadlink RM Pro that doesn't have this kind of annoying limit and it's much cheaper than this remote and harmony hub. It's only under 40 and that's when it's not on sale. I also wish they would have let us combined devices in order to increase our limits such as if you have the harmony hub which carries only 8 devices you'll have 8 + 15 from this harmony remote giving you a total device limit of 23. The nice thing though is there does not seem to be a limit of devices you can setup for SmatHome such as if you have SmartThings linked, you can pretty much put as many devices as you like.Price: It's a pretty expensive remote. It's hard to put 200 on this remote. I guess if I paid 200 for this remote, I would have rated this differently. But since I got this during the holidays for 100, it's a much better experience to me just because of that.Support: Logitech has email, live chat and phone support. So you have many options to chat with them. And they usually respond back and take care of your problems pretty well.Overall: I would recommend this product when it's on sale for 100 or less. As 200 is too much to ask for. I like this over using a smartphone as a remote because it's nice having a device that is dedicated as a remote only and nothing else. Smartphones have too much going for it and the lack of physical buttons don't make it as nicer to use as a dedicated remote. Even if you voice control for everything (Echo/Google Home), using a remote is sometimes nicer. I prefer changing the volume through remote rather then through Alexa but I prefer turning on the TV through Alexa through anything else. The amount of customization is nice but could be better. Having the ability to charge the remote two ways (Micro USB and cradle) is also nice. The remote has a nice design, feels good in the hands but the device limitations are for the most part the weakest point. I could get away with the other issues as they aren't such big issues but I would have loved to control more devices without having to find workarounds. Overall, I would recommend this remote only when it's 100 or less. I can't see myself putting 200 for any remote. (But who knows maybe I will)",4.0,1258,0.16586123626939941,0,35,1,0.21706938186530034,-0.17366417765643583,-1
"I never thought I could get excited over a remote control, but I did with this one. First of all, let me state that I was on the fence after reading the reviews here on Amazon, but I took the plunge and so far I'm not regretting it. This is my first Harmony remote, so I obviously can't make comparisons with previous models which might have been better than the unit presently under review.It took me 30 to 45 minutes to set up and sync my new remote through the Harmony software. That was a breeze, but it's important that you know your system and how its individual components are connected to each other. All my components were supported by the remote, so no problems there. I was able to customize the background image on the touchscreen. A nice touch, though not very important.Once the first sync from software to remote is completed, the remote will work on your system. As opposed to the previous situation, where you had four remotes lying around, you will now hit one button ('activity') and your TV, AV receiver and third component will turn on all at once. Great! At first this does not work flawlessly. For instance, you hit 'Watch TV' and everything might come on, but the AV receiver won't be on the right channel. The great thing about this remote, though, is that it learns on the job: It will ask you if the function performed as desired, and if not, how it can improve. After my initial use with every component, these flaws were pretty much ironed out. I now have a perfect remote with no issues whatsoever.One downside to all this automation is that the Harmony cannot predict when you've been fooling around with your equipment behind its back. Turned off your TV by hand using that device's own power button The Harmony doesn't know, so when you switch everything off through the remote (again: just ONE button), your TV will come back on again. You can work around this by customizing the color buttons on the bottom of the remote to be separate power on/off buttons for the individual components. You'll need to customize these buttons for every programmed activity, so there's an initial time investment involved. And of course there are no markings for these functions on the remote, so you'll have to memorize everything. All in all this is not ideal.If you want to nitpick, a few other minor cons are: 1) the sluggish touchscreen and 2) slightly flimsy buttons. This is nothing I can get worked up about.None of the downsides mentioned above can put a damper on my excitement. I'm very happy with this product. I'm still a tiny bit worried about the negative reviews and, subsequently, the longevity of this remote. Time will tell, and I'll adjust my rating if this thing fails within the first year or so. So far I'd highly recommend it. Great product!",5.0,494,0.11428463203463204,2,17,1,0.442857683982684,-0.10128693439996339,-1
"This is my second Logitech Harmony remote. I had my first one for eight years and loved it.I HATE this remote!!!Yes hate.Honestly, I don't even think it should be in the same category as my old Harmony remote. This version is a significant downgrade. The buttons have far less customization, the our old remote. The layout of the buttons on the remote lack a comfortable feel and placement. The removal of the number buttons in favor of the touch screen might not seem like a big deal. But instead of being about to press in 300 for your favorite channel you now need to: Touch the Screen Swipe to unlock If it doesn't come up to the number screen you have to flip through the screens to find the numbers Then enter the 300Who at Logitech thought doubling the number of keystrokes needed made any sense at all I certainly don't!I will say, this remote does eliminate the need for multiple remotes. But the downsides of this remote really don't make me happy about the amount of money that it cost.",2.0,181,0.09446169772256728,4,4,1,0.14723084886128357,-0.011899860797856765,-1
"I am a Harmony user, and decided I needed to replace my trusty Harmony One as the buttons have been worn off and the mute button sometimes does not work. SO I picked up the Ultimate. This is the replacement, right It's probably better, right I had read about some people having issues with the button placement and others saying it was no big deal, so I got one. I set it up (instantly using the Harmony software. No one does this better IMO) and started using it. It sucked. The touch screen was slow, much too slow to control a DVR. The hard button placement is STUPID, making them difficult to use, and there is no numeric keypad. Well yes, there is a soft keypad three swipes away on the touch screen, but it's not as fast nor as easy as real buttons. OK, I thought, I am just suffering through a learning curve. I'll get used to it and things will get better. So I lived with it for two months. Struggled with it, I should say. This thing is useless to properly control a DVR. The hard buttons are in the absolute wrong location. The touch screen gesture control works only when it decides to work (and usually if you set the remote down and inadvertently do something when your hand moves over the face.) And speaking of setting it down, whoever designed this has never used a remote control in the real world. The bottom is not flat. Yes, it can feel nice in your hand, yes the charging stand is good, but try setting the remote on a table, or worse yet on the curved arm of an easy chair, and watch it roll over. After two months of almost slamming this thing against the wall on numerous occasions, I put it in the drawer and re-charged my old design One. Ah. Now I can relax again when I watch TV.

"I purchased this remote after my 650 died after 4 years and what a disaster!After spending 2+ hours seting this up ith all my devices (X1 DVR, Pioneer AVR, Sony CD changer, PS3, PS4, Amazon Fire TV and HTPC) i figured cool - it IS a little cumbersome where the button placement is for certain tasks it SEEMED to work ok until i actually started using it!YES i know it does not support the PS3, PS4 or Fire TV without the additional hub BUT it doesnt seem to do much of anything right!1) i powered up the TV AVR with it but when i go to hit the DVR button it does nothing - have to go into main cable box menu then to DVR toaccess my recordings2) if i want to switch inputs to go to my HTPC, even thought i have set that up as task it does not switch inputs, i have to go to to the AVR menu then select the correct HDMI input3)if i want to switch back to my DVR i would THINK hitting WATCH TV would go back to my cable box NOPE! back to my AVR settings to select the HDMI inputi have several more complaints butian too frustrated to keep listing them herei REALLY like the 650 ( bought a new one before trying this remote) but unfortuntely i guess Logitech (or Microsoft) stopped supporting it under Widows 8.1 Pro because time i try to connect it to my PC using the MY Harmony software it either doesnt see the remote itself OR it freezes at 99 sync so that also doesnt work !!!!!!I am hoping that logitech comes out with new design OR i may have to wait til the NEEO remote comes out to try that",1.0,297,0.07508608815426995,10,36,1,0.3375430440771349,-0.14744962326077948,-1

"I've been using Harmony remotes for many years. I remember when there was no 90 day tech support deadline that's how far back I go. I purchased the new Ultimate One remote and installed the newer on line software. With this, I was able to set my remote up nicely. My old Harmony One worked but not as well as this new remote. My devices responded quicker and if it did not pick up a function the first time, I just selected Help and once it picked up that function, it actually remembered it from then on which the older remote did not do. I also bought the Hub. This is where my problems began. The Hub setup quite nicely with the new remote and actually made the remote work better, especially at longer distances. The only problem, at first, that I encountered was the Wi-Fi would not pick up so I called tech support. I have never had an issue with tech support within the 90 days allotted period but after 90 days you better have a credit card they will not help you, fact! Anyway, I was on the phone for over an hour and thirty minutes but they count not get the Hub to work with Wi-Fi so they escalated it up to level 2 support. She told me that they would contact me within 24 to 48 hours. That was around 11:30am on a Friday morning. Five days later on Wednesday around 9:05am I called them back requesting level 2 support. They told me that level 2 was busy and that they would call me back in just a few minutes. I heard nothing back that day. The next morning, Thursday, around 9:20am I called back and requested level 2 tech support. Mike told me that they were busy and that he would certainly have them call me back in a few minutes. At that point I told Mike that if level 2 did not call me back, that day, that I would be very upset. Mike said no problem and ended the conversation. Surprise! No call back that day either. So I called back on Friday morning around 10:20am and this time I was a little upset. I spoke to Kevin who read the notes from the day before and said he didn't understand why I was upset because the notes said that the second line tech was out on Thursday and that I was told that they would contact me on Friday. This was news to me. So it appears that Harmony tech support level one write down whatever note covers their butt but not necessarily the truth. Kevin said he would have a 2nd line tech call me right back. I said ok never thinking that I would ever receive a call back but to my surprise CJ called and we were able to start addressing the issues. After blowing out my perfect working remote, Ultimate One, and installing new software, firmware and the remote setup info the remote stopped working properly. The Hub issue was never fixed so I ended up calling Amazon, love Amazon, who offered me a refund or replacement. I actually took the replacement due to the fact that the remote originally worked so well. I am waiting for them to arrive and I will update you on what happens from here................................to be continued",2.0,565,0.09315977232643902,2,27,1,0.14657988616321949,-0.14321816625466732,-1
"Brilliant product. I have a somewhat more advanced home entertainment setup with a AV receiver, Roku, DVD, and fairly new Motorola DVR from FiOS and this configured and handled them all perfectly - the first time I set it up.The genius of the product is that it's programmed online and Logitech has thousands of components already identified - and they allow you to check in advance if your devices are directly supported with a look-up utility on their site. I wasn't sure about my Pioneer VSX-33TX THX receiver as it's probably 10 years old, but it was no problem. You connect the remote to your computer, Windows 7 found the drivers online without issue, then go to the Logitech setup site and create an account if you don't already have one. Then you type in the model numbers of everything that you have. If your setup is simple that may be all you need to do, but they take care of multiple 'keypress' needs very elegantly. For example, to play a DVD I have to change the plasma display to HDMI 2, set the AV receiver to DVD input, then turn on the DVD. Logitech's setup anticipated the devices and the inputs that I'd probably be using so all I needed to do was to confirm and save. Then a single touch to the onscreen display on the Harmony does it all.Be aware that like most IR remotes, it wants a pretty straight line-of-site to the components and any glass in between will weaken the signal. My components are all in a cabinet with glass doors about 12 feet from our seating area and remote control wasn't a problem although it was necessary to be pointing fairly directly at the cabinet. If you're not sure about distances or want to be lazy when aiming, pick up and install an IR repeater and it will solve that problem.Honestly, I have nothing negative to say about this device. The ergonomics and setup are inspired and so human friendly that even my wife was impressed. The 200 seems expensive initially but if you consider programming a typical button-only remote can take hours and I had this set up in 15 minutes, it quickly seems like money well spent.",5.0,375,0.1707824038706392,0,19,1,0.41460879806468043,-0.03694088955022812,-1

"To preface my review, I am not a technophobe and have programmed other Harmony remotes.After hours of programming and re-reprogramming the remote it still does not operate properly. When I think I have the problem solved the remote fails to perform a basic function like turning on or off my devices. Based on my experience this remote is not as easy as 1-2-3-4 to set up. This is a shame because the remote has some really nice features but all the great features in the world are of no value if the remote doesn't perform basic functions.You might wonder why not call customer service. I did and here is my experience. The bright spot about contacting customer service was that I was able to reach someone without waiting an hour to speak with someone. Also I called at 4:30 pm a half-hour before the service center closes and the customer serve rep worked with me past closing time. Bottom line was the customer service rep attempted to help me and went as far as remotely changing settings on the remote on-line which only made the problem worse. At one point I had to take a quick call and explained that I would put the rep on hold and be right back. As soon as I put the call on hold the rep hung up. No call back in case it was an accidental disconnect. I called back only to find the service center was closed. I was left standing there with my remote in my hand. A remote that did not operate. I was able to re-program the remote so it could operate albeit not properly.I can't recommend this product and urge you not to purchase this product. Clearly the product does not work as advertised and their customer service is pathetic. I will contact customer no-service this week when i have the time and update this review. But in the meantime don't waste your time or money on this remote.Update -We'll it has been almost a week since I wrote my review. Just to be clear none of my components or TV are concealed and well within range. Someone from Logitech contacted me via email (no phone). Unfortunately I am extremely busy during the week and could not speak to Ian Crowe although I did call Logitech in California and left a voice mail for Ian this afternoon. I tried to work with Logitech's customer no-service today. I spoke to someone off-shore somewhere. No help. In fact he tried to tell me my remote was an RF remote. Just to make sure this tech rep was wrong I called Vizio to ensure the remote was an IR remote. It is. Sadly I am still where I was last week. Sending me an email offering to help me is great but I need solutions not empty offers to help. Ian please call me.2nd Update - I have been working with Logitech's Senior Manager for Customer Service in the Bay Area, for the past two Fridays. It looks like the problem has been solved (crossing my fingers). I really appreciate the time and effort that Ian has made to make things right. Logitech is sending an optional hub to try in case the current fix does not work. If I have to return the remote Ian has promised a refund even if I return the remote after 30 days. I hope I don't have to use the hub or return the remote. If I have to return the remote it is not because of Logitech's not trying. I really believe that Ian has gone above and beyond what would be expected.The Bottom Line: This remote might be buggy depending on your AV equipment. But when it works, it works great. So far I really like using the remote. I especially like the favorites screen. I think my tech challenged wife will be able to use the remote too. Logitech has stepped up and helped make a bad situation a good one. I would recommend Logitech to a friend or family member. I changed the title of my review and gave the remote 3 stars from 1 star. Give this a product a shot understanding there could be a problem but Logitech will work with you to make it right. I hope the current fix works and I won't have to return the remote it really is great to use.",3.0,738,0.03959492888064317,0,42,1,0.08020253555967838,-0.14381032848785313,-1
"Ok folks, this remote is IR only, so if your devices are hidden, this is not the remote for you. Get the Ultimate with the hub. I have been using this remote only a few days and I really love it. I love the fact that it's so easy to customize. Also, the review who said they have poor customer service is mind boggling to me since one I have recieved two phones call and multiple e-mails and the personal cell phone of an exec over there in case I need input when I'm re-doing my media cabinet this weekend! If I could give 10 stars for customer service I would! The remote itself, it's early days yet but I really couldn't ask for anything better. It does exactly what I need it to do.

"After reading a lot of reviews both the good and bad. I went and ordered this one. I have had it about a week and this is the second Logitech remote. I honestly did not program the first Logitech remote, my husband did, he is not tech savvy at all, I have to teach him all the tricks with any device.So when he say this new one, he said it's up to me. That being said, I am not an expert and have at times had to result to calling my son to get me through the tech stuff. Well I will say it was very easy to program. But, I did have a lot of my devices info prior to starting the programming. I have 8 devices, DIRECTV, Apple TV, Roku, Yamaha receiver, Samsung, iPod dock to name a few. The remote controls all the devices with no issue.Now some complained about the buttons, the touch screen, swipe and even the vibration with touching. I turned off the vibration that fixed that. The touch of buttons on the touch screen might have a second or two lag in response time, but really not that bad. Compare it to what time takes to change between controllers, its less then that. The biggest thing is just getting used to having JUST ONE controller, learning to navigate between the devices with just 1 controller. Same with the gesture swipe it will take a bit getting used to just like anything else you have to learn. So far it easy for everyone in the family to use. Best thing my husband likes is the sleep mode for the touchscreen, it keeps from accidentally changing the channel or device. The only complaint would be the bump in the back for you fingers, I guess that is what it is for, it gets in the way at times. If things change about what I think I will add it, but so far I would recomend to anyone that has A lot of devices and wants just one controller",5.0,343,0.06608150470219436,0,18,1,0.46695924764890284,-0.05456770060725957,-1
"Very easy to program! Just put in your devices by model number and tell it where everything is connected (e.g. DVD is on input 1 on the TV). The software download from the Internet. Worked great on my MacBook Pro 15 (late 2013). You need to plug in the remote to program it (they call it sync) once everything is setup and it includes a USB to micro USB cable, so if you have a laptop with the new USB C connector, you will need to use an adaptor or buy a new cable, so new MacBook Pro (late 2016+) and MacBook users will need to figure out a cable solution.The Ultime One is IR, it doesn't include the RF base, but the base can be bought separately at a later date if you decide you need RF.We have Roku 3 and 4 players, which use RF on their included remotes, however the Roku player can receive IR too, but it's not as responsive as it is with RF. You also need to point the remote at the player, which you may not be used to if you use the Roku remote a lot. My daughter complained at first but I removed the battery from the old tv and Roku remotes (so they don't leak over time) and put them away, so she has to use the Logitech. After a few days she adapted to having to point the remote. Hopefully your significant other or kids are as flexible )The touch screen is responsive and easy to use. You can swipe over from the actions screen to the gesture screen and use it to easily raise or lower the volume (swipe up or down on the screen instead of using the volume up down buttons). It works great and so far I'm very happy with the purchase.1 star reduction because of the lower IR output requiring aiming more to use it.",4.0,321,0.07957070707070704,1,13,1,0.26021464646464654,-0.004301215869172648,-1
"At about 150, this is a good value for a universal IR remote. Button layout is a little odd with the play/stop/etc. buttons at top and touch screen is a little slow, at least compared to phones and tablets. Charging dock is nice.NOTE that this remote will NOT control devices over RF (e.g. Roku players) or Bluetooth (e.g. Playstation). That functionality requires a separate 100 hub, which can also be extended to control Zigbee and other types of IoT devices (approximately another 100).NOTE that this remote requires a computer to set up, otherwise it is just an expensive paperweight. Be sure to check the OS requirements. Also requires downloading software from Harmony, which went without a hitch once I disabled my VPN. For some reason it refused to download the program files on the VPN and gave the usual check that you are connected to the Internet advice. Turned out to be half right.Setup was easy. Will consider getting the hub to control non-IR devices.Arrived quickly and nicely packed. So far so good. :)",5.0,174,0.03405797101449275,0,8,63,0.4829710144927536,-0.10327693333051757,-1
This remote works fine and does what it is supposed to do. The only problem that I have had with it is the unfortunate placement of the volume control. If one is not extra careful it is too easy to hit the exit button which is directly above the volume control. When that happens the entire streaming sequence is shut off and one has to start my vet again from the beginning. Perhaps a software solution could be developed which would require a double click on the exit button in order to activate it.

"This is the worst Harmony I've ever used. It's an ergonomic disaster with little that is done right. It is however still a Harmony, so it somehow salvages 3 stars for what they all do right.It seemed nice in the box, and it was a breeze transferring everything from my Harmony 700 to this via the My Harmony program. The weight and balance are good and the charging cradle works well. Everything else ranges from bad to worse.Maybe one day the screen/pad will do what I need it to do, but for now it's rubbish and it's in the location where the most used buttons should be. As a result those buttons are below (4 way controller, volume, channel, etc... or above (play, pause, etc...). Ugh! Worse yet the screen/pad isn't just dead space (honestly it would be better if it were), rather it's live. That can be ok when it's acting like a touch pad with various taps and swipes to do things (it never works that well, but I see what they're trying to do), but it's a disaster when it's live with functions that are so seldom used there's no dedicated button. So channel favorites, random superfluous functions, etc get accidentally pressed. Even then they hardly work in the case of the favorites with my Motorola cable box running Uverse (95 of the time 2 or 3 of the 4 digits are recognized). When you avoid that pad the other buttons are cramped and arranged poorly even within their poor locations. The 4 way pad is small, as are the play and pause buttons and the skip and fast forward buttons are shared. Of all the sacrifices made for the screen/pad, those red, green, yellow, and blue buttons you never use are still there--UGH!!!!!Move the screen up, move the key buttons where the fingers land, kill the color keyed buttons that don't ever do s***, and try again. Oh and the battery life sucks too. Please make a new flagship controller ala the Harmony One (original) 880, etc... Hell the 700s I have are better than this!The Harmony software and ecosystem is still strong, and as noted before, there's a lot this gets right, but so does every other Harmony and they lack this ergonomic disaster.",3.0,379,0.02249128186628185,7,3,1,0.08875435906685902,-0.1065750917033581,-1
"We had an older Logitech remote that was programmable through their web app. The puppy decided he liked the remote better than we did, and although it still worked after the application of some CSI-style, crime-scene reconstruction forensics and super glue, it was time for a new remote now that he had grown up.This remote and the computer-based app is remarkable. If you can follow simple directions, the application walks you through each step. I write instruction and repair procedures, and I can tell you that the instructions in the app make it easy to get the remote working how you like. well done, Logitech!You Begin by entering the brand and model number of each device. On one of the older devices it gave a screen message that there are control variations with that model and to consult them if there was a problem. It also popped up that the Roku was IR and RF and that this remote was only IR. It even handled an old VCR and a not-quite-as-old DVD recorder. Ya... we're old. So whatOnce all your devices are entered you create Activities. For example, for watching TV we use our receiver, the LCD TV and the antenna. It even asks if we wanted the Onkyo or the TV to control the volume and what input on the TV to use for this activity and what input on the receiver. I was easily able to create an FM activity to listen to the radio in the morning. With dreary morning eyes, just we only have to press the FM screen icon in the activities window on the touch screen.Additionally, I created two custom activities- one for watching HULU and one for watching NETFLIX using our Roku3. I was able to customize it so that the remote would start the TV, Start the Onkyo, and select the Roku. At that point it sent the signals to emulate remote key selections for HOME/Click Right/click Right/OK to get to Hulu. I did much the same for Netflix. I found that these two custom Activities would not go back and forth between the two. The solution was to add a two second delay between HOME and go right. The app made that easy as one of the custom items which could be selected in the app was ADD DELAY and you can select the length of the delay as well. Handy for troubleshooting should it become necessary. The custom items (such as the button presses) can be reordered when programming them as well. In that way, when I found the two custom Activities were not working properly I went back into the app, added a delay, and then moved the delay up to just after Home.If you are not sure, you can download the MyHarmony desktop software at the Logitech website and program in all the various devices to see how it works before even purchasing the remote.Although I gave it five stars, it is not perfect:- One problem I had with the last Harmony remote model and this one as well is that it is made to fit in your hand. Unfortunately, that same ergonomic design makes it very difficult to click something as simple as Mute when the remote is sitting on the table.- Allowing the application to auto-program the favorite channels will work fine for most people, but if you live in a rural area and get channels from different directions (like when using an antenna rotor), you can't automatically add the channels from both directions. Pick one or the other. The solution is to add the channels you watch manually, and that can be done right on the remote. Afterwards, synch the remote on the computer and they will be saved there was well.- Finally, the battery is not meant to be user replaceable, but a search on YouTube will show you that it can be done fairly easily, just in case the battery dies before the remote does.If I had known these things before I bought it, would it have changed my mind! No. I have been writing reviews in the coffee industry for nearly 16 years and try to be balanced in my appraisals. This is why I added the above.This model is evidently no longer for sale at Logitech, and I hope that this is not an indication that it is discontinued as that would be too bad. If you don't need the home automation and smart phone app, this remote might just be what you are looking for. We got ours as a refurb for under 120, delivered with sales tax. What a deal!",5.0,771,0.0709652326839827,3,34,1,0.46451738365800865,-0.17750078449649342,-1
"I upgraded to this from a Harmony One, which I loved but was just starting to feel kind of old. I read a lot of reviews and complaints about this model's button layout. I figured people were just exagerating, how hard can it be to learn a new layout and get used to the play-pause controls being at the top of the remote instead of the middle. You have to hold the remote by the top to use the commands, but thats not the big problem for me. Instead its the brain dead designers that put the power button millimeters above the similarly shaped rewind button. The number of times I've accidently shut my whole system off while trying to quickly rewind something... extremely frustrating.Another issue with holding the remote at the top to use the play-pause controls is that your thumb or hand will often press the touch screen. This is a design flaw they tried to solve by putting a lock on the touch screen. When the touch screen activates you have to slide the lock screen over to use the touch buttons. This got old real fast, it adds an annoying extra step to trying to use your fancy (supposedly) convienent universal remote. Disabling the lock screen, however, means that my remote's touch screen is constantly ending up on the numeric or favorites page for some reason. Two pages I never use and wish I could just turn off or hide, but cant.And finally, the biggest problem with this remote. The battery. The Harmony One's battery lasted forever and when it was running low, the remote would smartly remind you to recharge it. This new Harmony lasts a few days if youre lucky, and has no charging reminder. So I'll use it for two days the battery indicator around 70, then the next days its completely dead and wont even turn on. So you cant use your remote until its gotten enough charge to function. If you remember to ALWAYS put the remote on the charger when youre not using it, this wont be an issue. But for me its a constant and frustrating problem with an overall poorly designed and bad upgrade of a once excellent universal remote.",2.0,372,0.019122714020673195,0,7,1,0.10956135701033654,-0.013677610107003524,-1
"Okay, semi expert here. This is my fourth Harmony universal remote in about ten years. Perhaps that leads to conclusions about issues of longevity I'm a little torn on that. Yes, they do get daily work, but a little more in the build quality, especially for the steep price, seems warranted. Battery life on the previous models was also not good - I am talking about rechargeable models.Sadly, nobody makes as usable as a remote as Logitech/Harmony. If I am wrong please tell me in the comments - I am willing to switch!While easy to use, easy to set up is not the same thing. If you are tech savvy, it is not too difficult and the biggest challenge is first, getting all your correct model numbers for all your gear, second, knowing enough about how you have all this set up in terms of both audio and video inputs and outputs. Advice, write it down and keep it on file. That is a fair amount of work and takes some knowledge. Unlike my last model, the default button setup for this and my different devices was a bit off. I had to customize button settings for my cable box (FIOS) to properly use the Favorites guide and a few other things including On Demand - that's right, no default button set up for On Demand. In actual use my wife was able to start using it right away, but there are some quibbles here and there on having this be the only remote we need. Back to cable, but some often used functions, like search, are more cumbersome with this than the FIOS remote. We can live with it and let that stay in a drawer, but again, for 250 I think we can all demand a bit more thoughtfulness and user testing. Not to be AV elitist, but I don't think your average person with an average set up is going to shell out 250 for a remote. We want ease of use, but also versatility. FYI, I am running this with a HD TV, audio video receiver and a 5.1 surround setup, FIOS cable box, Roku 4, blueray DVD player and (for old family stuff I am working to convert) an actual VHS VCR!P.S. Swipe gesture thing is a gimmick and not very useful - volume buttons are easier to use. Would have much rather had the effort of this go into lower cost or functionality. Form factor/ergonomics is not the best either. Volume, channel, guide - highly used buttons not in a natural position for the hand.

"Wow! that sums up this product.My better half was complaining the other day that our entertainment system is too complicated for her and how she hates having to use four different remotes and turn on three different devices just to watch a DVD or Bluray movie. So to make her life easier (Happy Wife Happy Life) I began to research and look into a good solid universal remote to control my media devices in a more user friendly way. I looked at several different Harmony models and a few of the others on the market.My System consists of a LG Flat screen, Sony Receiver, Sony Bluray player, Scientific Atlanta Cable box with DVR, Apple TV, Nintendo Wii, and a Sony Playstation 3.I needed a remote that would enable me to control all of these as well as have room for anything else I may add down the line. The programability and functions this remote offered seemed to fit the bill perfectly. So I ordered it.Took it out of the Apple inspired package and connected it to my Macbook Pro upon delivery. Downloaded the app from the website and it walked me thru the entire set up and programming process within minutes. i got the actions set up exactly how i wanted them, said what devices need to turn on and what inputs need to be switched, and it was done. 3 minutes for the remote to sync up from the computer and it was ready to go.First test showed this product does exactly what it says it does. And it just works. the remote feels good in the hand and I personally do not find the button placement to be awkward at all for the hard keys. Its a very sleek looking piece and most importantly does as advertised and does away with numerous remotes.I select Watch Apple TV action on the touch screen and it turns on the Apple TV, switches the receiver to the correct input and away it goes.Select Watch TV it kicks on the Cable box, switches to the correct input, and away we go.Yes its a little pricey, but its worth every penny.",5.0,358,0.1298441734417344,1,13,1,0.4350779132791328,-0.03231360422334839,-1
"Almost a month ago I paid over 1,000 for four hub based Harmony Logitech Remotes: Two Ultimate Home remotes (one white and one black) and one Ultimate One upgraded with the Smart Control and Ultimate Hub add-on.I have three A/V systems - in my bedroom, home gym and family room. I used the Ultimate One + Smart Control combination in my bedroom so that my wife and I could each have a remote on our side of the bed that would stay in sync with each other.I must say that the units are beautifully packaged and have a very attractive design. They feel good in the hand. I am somewhat of a techie and have had various learning/universal remotes over the years, and did not find the setup difficult. In fact, compared to past remotes in which setup involved hours of button pushing, the Harmony setup was a breeze. I was very impressed by the GUI interface - though the process of adding/editing devices and activities was agonizingly slow at times because of the sluggish slow-mo response of the iOS app during the setup stage.I was so excited to set-up and deploy these remotes in the three rooms and happy to tell my family about the new convenience we would all enjoy - no longer having to juggle multiple remotes and devices in each room.Everything seemed to work perfectly running the remotes through their paces after installation.Unfortunately the honeymoon did not last long. The first night I really used the remote to watch a movie I noticed there were times when I tried to pause or rewind the playback, and the commands did not work - the remote was frozen-up. Then, 10 to 30 seconds later the commands I had given would be executed and the movie would start executing the commands - the movie would pause, rewind, etc. Since I had pushed the buttons repeatedly the result was somewhat comical as the TV seemed spontaneously to be pausing, fast forwarding, etc. as it executed the command I had given 30 seconds ago. This problem exhibited itself with the volume control and other controls as well.The next week and a half were a nightmare dealing with first level Harmony (off-shore) tech support personnel who repeatedly ran me through time-consuming standard troubleshooting scripts involving resting and reprogramming the remotes - firmware updates, submitting logs to them - all with no result.Finally after multiple calls and many hours spent, I was firm in demanding that the matter be escalated to upper level support personnel. At first these upper level support people would not talk to me directly - until I became very insistent that I had no interest in speaking further to the standard support personnel. (I must say, however, that every support person I talked to - and there were many - were extremely courteous - in a uniform, scripted sort of way you might get in a nice chain restaurant.)I eventually found out that this is a firmware problem has existed for some time with Harmony touch-screen remotes. The upper-level Logitech Harmony engineers are well aware of the firmware bug that causes this problem - though the front line support personnel seem ignorant of the problem. See the following link on the Harmony support site which discusses the problem: http://forums.logitech.com/t5/Harmony-Hub-Based-Remotes/My-Harmony-Ultimate-is-very-slow-to-respond-when-i-tap-the/td-p/1243238 (Harmony was very reluctant to admit this problem existed so don't be surprised if the above link is taken down.)Just to be clear: this was NOT just a case of having gotten one defective unit. The freezing/delayed response problem was exhibited in all four of the remotes that I purchased. This is a universal firmware problem affecting this entire line of touch-screen remotes - and one which has been acknowledged to me by upper level Harmony engineers.The upper level support engineers had me submit my logs once again and told me that a firmware update was being worked on to fix the problem. They initially told me that the firmware update would be available in a couple of days. Then that estimate was extended to within a week. Two weeks later, not having received notice of the update, they finally conceded that they no longer had an estimated date for the firmware fix and they would be in contact with me when it was available.During this saga I called in to the Harmony support line countless times. The support line is answered with a recorded greeting from the head of Harmony customer experience who offers his personal email address at the end of the greeting and invites callers to email him directly if their concerns are not satisfied. I started to copy this person on my email exchanges with support engineers. Then I wrote two emails directly to him outlining my frustrations, providing incident numbers, and seeking his assistance. The response was . . . crickets. It's been almost three weeks since I first reached out to this person and still I have received no response from him. So I must conclude that the invitation to contact him directly is simply marketing B.S. Who knows, maybe he is not even a real person.Of course, I returned all four remotes before the Amazon 30 day return window expired.Seeking another alternative I found that the reviews online for the Harmony 650 remote were generally very positive. Call me a glutton for punishment after all the problems I had with the touch screen Harmony remotes - but last week I purchased two of the (much cheaper) Harmony 650 remotes to try out in my bedroom.So far (knock on wood) the Harmony 650s seem to be working out very well. They are older tech and do not have all of the bells and whistles of the touch screen remotes. But so far at least they seem actually to work! I find that I prefer them ergonomically since they have hard number buttons which are much more convenient than the touch screen remotes which you have to swipe to unlock, then swipe a second time to access the soft number buttons.If you have any components inside a cabinet you will need to utilize an IR extender kit in order to use the Harmony 650. There are several highly rated IR extender kits available on Amazon for a modest price. And the Harmony 650 won't control your Nest thermostat or Phillips Hue lights - if you have them. But you can already control these devices from your smart phone - so this is not much of a sacrifice.Because of the good experience I have had this past few days with the Harmony 650s in my bedroom, I just ordered two more Harmony 650s to replace the Ultimate Home remotes I had tried unsuccessfully to use in my family room and home gym. My family room is a closed cabinet system so I also ordered an IR Extender kit for that location.Keep in mind that I have only had the Harmony 650s for less than a week. It is possible that problems might crop up. But if I end up having problems with the Harmony 650s I pledge to update this review with that information.I seldom write reviews and have certainly never written such an extensive one. But after all of the wasted hours and frustration these remotes caused me I felt somewhat of a civic duty to warn others of the serious problems they are likely to experience with these remotes.Update to prior review as of 1/21/2015: I have received support on this issue. There is a firmware update that Logitech has given me for the Ultimate One (4.2.48), which has for the most part fixed the delayed response/freeze-up problems that I was having previously. As of the date of this update, this firmware has not yet been released for the Ultimate One, but should be available for the Ultimate Home remote. However, if you have these problems with the Ultimate One I suspect that you can get this update from tech support. It should be widely available soon. With this fix I can recommend the remote.",4.0,1341,0.11026665956993822,1,49,1,0.24486667021503095,-0.18637730341121128,-1
"After reading the nasty reviews of this quality product, I had 2nd thoughts about the purchase. After my 1st use, I was convinced that this is not only a huge improvement over my Harmony 890, but might just be the 'perfect' universal remote. Setup was dead easy and took only a few minutes while the setup software copied the settings from my 890. The touch screen eliminates all of the ergonomic' issues that have been ballyhooed in those ugly reviews. And, I haven't even delved into the macro possibilities of the touch screen. That I will save for a quieter day. I purchased the 200 model as I do not see the need for my remote to close the drapes or turn on the lights. A nice price for an excellent product.",5.0,132,0.08095238095238096,0,7,63,0.45952380952380956,-0.09308480061307123,-1
"Purchased it last year, was unable to get it working in on a complex system, spend 4+ hours with no luck. Today I figured I would try it on a less complex system, just two components. Well after 2 hours, it still does not work. I gave up buying any Logitech years ago for my computer systems when simple things like mice and speakers failed to perform. Now after paying 250 for a less then useful remote, I hope they enjoyed it, don't ever expect purchases from me again.",1.0,89,-0.11212121212121212,0,4,63,0.24393939393939396,-0.07794341106505664,-1
"I love the old Harmony One 900 Remote. It is a great remote. About a year ago it could no longer hold a charge, so I got a replacement battery on Amazon. When I tried to replace it, I noticed that the stock battery was so inflated that it would not come out. I talked to Logitech tech support, and Logitech being the incredible company that it is, sent me a replacement. The problem is they no longer produce the 900, so I got this thing. I have used it for about a year. It is a fine remote if you have never used the 900, or never use the tracking buttons located at the top of the remote. If you do, as I do, and as many reviewers do, you will be annoyed with it. Proponents of this remote will tell you that you can program any button you want on the touchscreen, but not everything benefits from a touch screen interface. Remote buttons are one of those things. Especially when you don't want to take your eyes off your TV. Have you ever tried to control your A/V equipment using the IR blaster on your phone Its a similar experience.Pros:Nice ergonomic back, allows for dual handhold positions, which are required to access tracking buttons at topIR blaster works niceNew software allows easier programming- It was pretty easy before however.The charging base is ok, I prefer the 900 charging base where the remote lies flat.The battery isn't about to explode.Cons:Using it as a remote.There are touchscreen buttons to go back on the screen without a hard button return. Most users, thanks to Apple, are accustomed to a permanent go back hard button. This doesn't exist.In the end:I couldn't use it anymore. I found a tutorial online how to dismantle the 900, replaced the battery, and it works as good as new. Much better experience.",3.0,315,0.11415719696969696,0,13,1,0.04292140151515145,-0.012729963958582058,-1
"Like most people I hate having seven remotes to control my system so combining them into one unit is a great idea. I appreciate the opportunity to review the Ultimate One and compare it to my two-year-old One with the failing buttons. Although the Ultimate One is pretty smart and quite functional in many ways, Logitech misses the mark for me on several important points.Software: Try finding Roku for the Harmony. There are several classifications to look under but none of them make sense for Roku. It's listed under DVD. Go figure. Try Apple TV. Good luck with that one. Brand new hardware (Ultimate One) with the same old crappy software. If they spent a couple of days with a new software team leader in charge, maybe they'd come up with a better system, but this one has irritated me since I bought the old One more than two years ago.Hardware: Improved the shape and size over the old One so that now it stands up in the charging stand, taking up much less room on the table where it sits. Also added a textured back to make it easier to grip. They got rid of the superfluous buttons that cluttered up the old One, but also removed some pretty useful ones. These buttons are now accessed through layers of a touch screen. Sometimes this works out well, and sometimes not. Really depends on your equipment and the type of controlling you need to do. For me, I still keep the original remotes close enough that I can use them to do the more intricate things I don't want to bother setting up and troubleshooting on the Harmony. Yes, troubleshoot. Not everything works right the first time.Some inconveniences: Ever hand your remote to someone so they can control things Well, be careful with the Ultimate. About 1/4 times one of us will accidentally activate something on the touchscreen during transfer from one hand to the other, and we're being careful. Also, for some reason they put the playback buttons (play, FF, REW, etc) above the touchscreen. Try using those without activating something on the touchscreen!Set up: Since I already had a Harmony One that was fine-tuned to my system (which took months to finesse!!!), set up was just a matter of transferring the information from the One to the Ultimate. Easy-cheesy. I don't look forward to learning how to set up the Ultimate for a new piece of equipment after seeing that the software is still the same: lame. For now, the Ultimate controls most things fine with no fuss on my part.If you want to get rid of all of your remotes the Ultimate One could be your solution. For me it wasn't. If you want the convenience of controlling most of the common functions of a lot of equipment and don't mind the limitations, then this expensive remote could be a great addition to your collection. We now have nine remotes instead of the seven that came with the equipment. The old One is still on the charger for my wife's use (she doesn't care for the lack of buttons on the Ultimate). The Ultimate is for me, most of the time. The individual equipment remotes are stashed close-by in case I need to access something I can't find on the Ultimate.If Logitech would update their software to the 21st century (they still have Laserdisc but don't have a proper category for ROKU) and put the touch screen at the top with all of the buttons grouped together, I'd love the Ultimate One. If they don't make changes to the software I won't buy a new One when this One wears out.",3.0,614,0.12849927849927853,4,16,1,0.035750360750360755,-0.12143862744628264,-1
"I have been using Logitech items for quite a while from mice to previous remotes. I was offered the chance to review this item and my impressions are favorable.1. What's in the box You receive the remote, plus the charging cradle and a brief instruction booklet.2. Aesthetic: I have the previous Harmony One remote and in comparison this unit is smaller. It is simply much more compact. The first obvious difference is the lack of a numerical keyboard. Second, this unit is designed to sit vertically in the charger (as opposed to horizontally with the previous model). Also, the off button, and many of the buttons are quite a bit smaller. The bottom side has a nice, rough material that seems resistant to slipping.3. Use: First off, I charged the remote for a while (a couple of hours) before doing anything. Once I got the unit turned on, I was directed to add information. I must confess that because I had a previous Harmony, the process of adding information was simple. However, one positive aspect is the account for adding information (and that is adding the components of your system and needs by each activity (TV, DVD, videogame console, etc) has been moved off from a computer based server, to a cloud based server. I did need to upgrade my account to the cloud by registering, but the cloud seemed to understand my need to upgrade and simply asked for a connection through the included USB cord and transferred the information. Advantage While I have my laptop, if for some reason my laptop takes a dive, I can use another computer to upgrade my remote easily.Actual use: Once I got everything squared away, I turned on the TV with the remote and began to figure this system out. This is quite a change from the previous remote. The touchscreen in the middle is a important part of the system. There are two buttons at the top ( a star (for favorite channels (easy to set up based on TV provider and channels available) and a Home button for activities). Once the thing is on you can switch between favorite channels, activities, a number pad, and a command page by swiping around. Also, there is a swipe on the bottom for bringing up the gestures page which enables the user to pause, play and change volume (amongst other functions).Nicely, there are buttons on the remote that make the touch-screen duplicative.In many ways, this system is a huge improvement over the previous version. I was originally not able to understand the system, but after a bit of use, the ways of this remote become pretty intuitive. I love how you can easily go to things like a help function (more on that in a bit), a devices button and ways to adjust the remote on the fly without having to access the cloud to update the remote.What things didn't I like (There are only a few things that are irritating on this remote based on my use. First off, I really wish that the remote didn't have the IR outlet on the bottom as opposed to the top like the previous remote. As this seems to be line of sight, which sometimes means that I have to hold the remote upwards rather than simply pointing (for some this is probably okay, but for me this seems dorky)). UPDATE: Once I posted this review, someone thoughtfully pointed out that my supposed complaint about the IR sensor being on the bottom was incorrect and actually that button is for the remote learning function. In fact, I simply had to point the remote at the system as always. Guess what Using the remote with the remote pointed at the system worked extremely well. Gone were the second presses and the irritations that the remote would miss some function. It works and I haven't had a problem since. So this is NOT a problem at all.Another irritation is that I think this remote makes it harder to have a older person or less techy person at the home as the help button is buried in the sub-menu instead of being readily available for those not familiar with the system. Though this is not something that occurs often, it is something I think about and I think this was a bad mistake (if you have older parents coming over this will be an issues).Overall: In many ways this is a great remote. I have really come to appreciate the touch-screen and the levels of menus accessible with this remote. Although there are some irritations, I still think this is a very nice remote and well worth the purchase to make things more simplistic with the home theater (who needs 5 remotes). With that in mind, I really really like this item, but I don't love it yet based on the quibbles above. This doesn't mean that are better solutions around, because I haven't seen them.++++Update: After some extensive use and modification, I am really starting to LOVE this item. The ability to make some slight changes without having to hook this up to the computer is terrific (such as modifying icon placements, start positions and similar things, this makes life easier) as well as the overall use, which as I become more used to the functions, becomes far easier. This is a great update and I am hiving some fun with even being able to modify individual icons on the channels. Awesome! The software package makes this incredibly easy to do, unlike the previous iteration which was far tougher.",5.0,932,0.11293695887445894,1,42,1,0.44353152056277056,-0.17289025470368535,-1
"I've owned five Harmony remotes before this one. Before now, the setup has always been a no-brainer. I just finished the setup for this remote and it took me almost three hours. After all those hours I'm still completely dissatisfied.For starters, I had a very annoying problem with the initial setup. I could set up all of the devices and the activities, but then it would take forever to sync. It would hang at about 20-30 and never get past that point. I searched through many Logitech forums and found some suggestions that seemed to kind of help, but never quite got to 100. I even tried a different PC, which was strange because instead of using the same web-based installer it made me install the MyHarmony app on my other PC (same versions of Windows 7...no idea why it wouldn't use the same installer). Sitting at that different PC I finally got the idea to swap out a different USB cable. It turned out that the cheap stock USB cable had a bad micro USB connector. My AmazonBasics USB cable worked though.After that I was able to sync reliably every time. Then I had to make quite a few more changes and sync and re-sync.Now that it's completely set up, there's still one annoyance I can't resolve. Every time I launch the Watch TV activity (the main activity that I want to use this remote for) it changes the input on my TV. Then I have to manually change the input on the TV back to the right HDMI input. If this is an intelligent remote, it should know that the last activity was Watch TV and that there's no reason to change the input. I have no clue why it tries to change the input every time, and every time it picks the wrong one.If I switch from Watch TV to Watch Movie, it will operate my DVD player correctly, but again it picks some random (and wrong!) input on the TV. It's very frustrating.Aside from these frustrations, I don't like the form factor or the layout on this Harmony remote as much as I liked my previous Harmony remotes. The LCD screen gets very dirty. It defaults to a weird home page that I don't like.I'm very frustrated. It feels like their Harmony product line has gone the wrong direction over the years. I hope they can correct their course, because I'm a long time fan of these remotes.",1.0,412,-0.05903061224489795,1,34,1,0.27048469387755103,-0.10832507637668187,-1
"Logitech Harmony Ultimate One IR Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control (915-000224)Logitech finally came up with a replacement for the supremely popular Harmony One remote. It is called the Ultimate One and it is essentially the Ultimate without the RF kit. It is exactly that because in the software there is an upgrade offer to sell you the RF puck and cables to transform this to the Ultimate. It adds the missing features like controlling devices in a cabinet and setting up smart devices, like an iPhone, to act as remotes. Its a good way to start out slow and add features if you need them. The upgrade is one hundred dollars, the same difference between the Ultimate and Ultimate One so its a reasonable way to expand it.The hand feel of the remote is good. It isnt too heavy and its smaller than the remotes that preceded it. The touch screen is larger than earlier models and there are fewer hard keys than before too. I do miss some easy to use keys over the touch screen but Im getting used to the overall use. The screen visual quality is good but because of the layout Favorite icons are smaller than before and they suffer in terms of resolution. Overall the screen is easy to see and the hard buttons are all backlit for easy seeing in the dark. The lights all go dim by a user settable timer. The afore mentioned icons can be used to set up 50 favorite channels for ONE provider. This is the biggest shortcoming for the current line-up of Harmony remotes. Previously you were able to set up multiple carriers, such as Time Warner Cable and Over The Air and have sets of icons for each one. That ended with the new software and new remotes. Tech support says they are considering a change but as of this writing, its as it is. There have been numerous updates and feature enhancements for the Ultimate remote and the U1 takes advantage of them. Among the updates was the addition of a sleep timer in the remote so you can shut off the activity you are watching while falling asleep. They also added the ability to add custom backgrounds, in addition to the included set. A good source for custom icons and soon, backgrounds is iconharmony dot com. Using these custom graphics really helps to personalize your remote.My one main nit to pick with the hardware is the choice to seal in the battery. On previous remotes Logitech had issues with the battery pack expanding and they wound up replacing many remotes. I dont think the solution to use a custom sealed in battery is a good choice. When the battery dies you will have to mail in the remote to them or a service center. Not a great solution in my opinion.You program the remote with a website app at myharmony dot com. On the forum they recently announced a new software offline solution is being rolled out. This was how it used to be and many are happy it is coming back. This is a very good but not perfect and certainly not an Ultimate remote. I do like it and have grown used to it, including using its brother The Ultimate, and I do like it. If I was designing it Id have used a much higher resolution screen and used standard rechargeable, replaceable batteries. So Im deducting one star but still recommend it for its usability with the vast amount of systems.",4.0,591,0.10879689754689759,0,11,1,0.24560155122655125,-0.06492617341127715,-1
"I'm not going to go to much into it, since many other reviewers have given in depth breakdowns of all this remote's features, pros, and cons. I just wanted to quickly share my experience with this remote. I'm using the remote only, with no harmony hub. First off, this remote is about as sexy as remotes can get. It feels great in the hand, and is very ergonomic, all of the buttons are easily accessible with one hand. The battery came with enough juice for me to setup and tinker right out of the box. Setup is a breeze add devices, add activities, add favorites, done in 10 minutes max. I initially had trouble with the activities. The remote was not giving my TV long enough to turn on, so it wasn't switching to the proper input. I though I was going to have to go in and tinker with the delay settings, but the remote asked me if everything went smoothly, and when I told it no, it asked me a few simple questions to determine what went wrong, and get me watching immediately. After that, I had no more issues. Based on my answers to the questions it asked me, it automatically adjusted the delays between commands, no need to hook it back up to my computer. On some of the older harmony remotes that I've used, you had to turn all of your devices off in order to start a new activity. With this remote, the TV can stay on. When I am in a watch blu ray activity, and I press watch xbox, it turns off my blu ray player, turns on my xbox, and switches the inputs on my TV, fantastic!! I can't begin to express how pleased I am with this remote. It replaced 6 big clunky remotes, and works like a charm. That being said, there are 3 features I would like to see added, and they are all things that can be added with a firmware update on Logitech's end. When switching activities, I want it to ask me if I want to power off my current device, instead of just doing it automatically. I would also like the option to have the remote display a clock when docked, that way it serves a purpose when its just sitting there on your end table. It could also serve as a digital picture frame. It could easily store a couple dozen photos, and cycle through them while docked. If those feature were added, then remote controls can be improved upon no further. If you can spare 1/4 G, buy it right now.",5.0,439,0.08431251288394141,2,18,1,0.45784374355802926,-0.09090089175589733,-1
"OK, I stole the review title from the infamous Highlander movie, but I did so because it does apply. The Harmony One, in world of universal remotes, really is the one remote that can replace all of your device remotes, but does so at a seemingly steep price, and with a small investment of time unless you are upgrading from another Logitech remote and your devices are already input into your online Logitech profile.This is my third Logitech remote - I am upgrading from an older model, the 650. The programming software I was using to update my 650 is no longer used by Logitech, nor does it even recognize the Ultimate One. So, despite logging in and repeatedly clicking upgrade remote, the remote could not connect to the Logitech website. I wasted two nights and about two hours trying to solve this problem and finally learned via Google that the One is not compatible with the old software. It would have been nice if this had been noted somewhere on the instructions.I was less than thrilled when I learned I would need to create a new profile and user name rather than simply logging in at the Logitech website with my existing information. Once I did, thankfully it asked if I had an existing account and once I entered my old information, it allowed me to port over all my existing devices. So, I got to where I needed to be but it took longer than it should have.Those of you who have Logitech remotes know that you enter your devices (TV model, DVD player, Home Theater Receiver model, etc) and then the software allows you to set up activities like watching a movie, playing a game. etc., and the software prompts you with questions about which device controls what function. (e.g., which device controls sound and volume, etc.) Once this is all programmed, you update the remote (which is connected to your computer) and off you go. Once this data is entered and configured, the One really shines. It lights up when you pick it up. You can control all your devices of course with just the one remote. You can even stagger power on or off order if you want. It will set your TV and other devices to the correct inputs if they need to be changed between functions.I use an Xbox One to watch my Blu Rays and DVD's. The Xbox controller is a poor TV remote. We like subtitles on when we watch DVD's. I was able to set up a quick one button macro in the Logitech software that walks through the four button presses required on the Xbox One to enable subtitles with a single button press on the Ultimate One. The software allows a high degree of customization that I really appreciate.Of course, this programming ability is part of what drives the high cost of the product. This isn't just a remote. It is really a software driven input device with a touch screen. (I use a combination of the touch screen and my buttons depending on my mood). It lights up when you pick it up, feels good in your hands, and in a feature I really like - it has its own charging cradle. Past versions really ate up batteries. I like returning it to its charging cradle after use because I know where it is when I need it again, and it saves me the cost of replacing batteries.As others have noted, not everyone would consider spending 250 on a remote. Even if you are willing to spend the money, you still need some basic technological prowess to program and fine tune this remote to make it work for you. If you have relatives that still struggle with basic computer tasks or how to program their DVR to record their favorite shows, this is not a product for them. I have family members who could not ever hope to program this remote. It is not a complex task to do so, but for people who struggle with technology, programming this remote could be a formidable task.I have a fairly simple home theater line-up with no line of sight issues, so I can't address using this with a hub.

I HAD THE HARMONY ONE FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS AND THE TOUCH SCREEN JUST FROZE UP AND WOULD NOT WORK AGAIN WARANTY WAS UP AND LOGITECH WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. I WANTED TO BUY ANOTHER BUT THEY WERE DISCONTINUED SO I HAD TO BUY THIS HARMONY ULTIMATE ONE REMOTE. VERY DISSATISFIED!! I DO NOT LIKE THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE HARD NUMBER BUTTONS ON IT SO YOU HAVE TO USE THE TOUCH SCREEN. ALSO ALOT OF TIMES I PUT IT DOWN AND IT SWITCHES ACTIVITIES. WHEN I AM IN MY SMART HUB OCCASIONALLY THE REMOTE SEEMS TO FORGET WHICH ACTIVITY IT IS IN AND SOME OF THE FUNCTIONS DO NOT WORK SO I HAVE TO RESET IT BY STARTING ALL OVER. I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE FIRST REMOTE AND I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY IT WAS DISCONTINUED.

"I've used harmony remotes for probably a decade now, and I was underwhelmed by this model. Basic setup is easy enough, but it doesn't seem to reliably apply the settings to all of my devices. Usually this is a problem with the receiver, it doesn't always go to the right input. Advanced setup is no longer intuitive at all, maybe I was spoiled by the earlier remotes software, but this one is definitely more complex. The battery seems to last about a week of normal use, sometimes less, my earlier remotes would go closer to a month.On the positive side it does seem to be well constructed, and has survived a couple of drops unscathed. The LED is easy to read, and the button placement is pretty intuitive.",3.0,128,0.1226866883116883,0,3,63,0.038656655844155785,-0.06364378008989546,-1
"This is an initial review based on just having received my Harmony One and getting it set up. I will update it if my observations or opinions change. I acquired this through my company's award's program, otherwise I would have purchased it through Amazon. That said, it IS an expensive remote, but ... I think it is worth the price.This is my second Harmony, my first being the Harmony 700. I have been very happy with the 700, but it was getting a little long in the tooth, and I think some problems were developing. So, despite some of the negatives in reviews here, I decided to give the Ultimate One a try.First, I would like to address the ergonomics issue, specifically with regard to position of the controls for DVD/DVR/BluRay playback. I agree that for some this is a significant negative, but I think that ignores one major factor: the Harmony Ultimate One is primarily a TOUCH SCREEN DEVICE. These controls are available on the touch screen. To access the movement controls, you simply touch an up arrow button at the bottom of the screen. There, I've saved a bunch of people some heartache ... you're welcome!Further to the touch screen, there are multiple screen pages available. As with smart phones and other touch screen mobile devices, you simply swipe through the screens. Even with the default settings, you can control most, if not all device and activity functions. Naturally, after a limited time using the remote, I will probably discover some things I want to tweak or add. But that's true with any new device.One feature that was not available on my 700 (which I plan to wipe and reprogram for a setup in a different room) is the ability to download favourite channels based on your location (zip code or postal code) and provider. Whoa, that is cool -- it saves a lot of time.The next new feature not available on my 700 is that this is primarily a WiFi based remote. I wasn't sure how this would work, and whether the hub/blaster architecture would work properly for my physical entertainment centre. However, connecting to my WiFi network was flawless and the signalling to devices has worked perfectly as far as I can tell at this point.And in regard to signalling, the Ultimate One is MUCH faster than my 700. Maybe when I reprogram the 700 I can speed it up, but at this point I think the Ultimate is just plain better.The setup of the Ultimate One was quick and painless. The web-based installation gave me the option of transferring the settings from the 700 to the Ultimate, and it worked perfectly. Even without this advantage, first-time owners of a Harmony remote will find program so much easier than most other universal remotes.After getting the Ultimate set up, I downloaded the Harmony Control app for my iPond Touch, and my wife will download the app for her iPhone and iPad. My brief experience with the app is that it is cleanly designed and performs well.So my summary for initial impressions is that this is a great remote. I frankly think that a lot of negative points in reviews are overblown. I am not judging the reviewers, but think that the overall perspective of having a solidly designed, well manufactured remote that offers the performance that it does, well, my opinion is many if not of the most of the niggles are minor. Just my opinion.",5.0,579,0.12575439266615737,1,26,1,0.43712280366692136,-0.1267193252110379,-1
"While the universal remote concept is great idea, i.e. combine many remotes into ONE... its not without complications... like others here, I have tried these in the past, and there always seems to be a gotcha after you are 25 hours deep into making it work ideally... pay attention to these reviews....line of sight is a big issue, although they do sell an RF adapter, even that might always work, so be sure to buy with return policy. Harmony line is getting better overall, better web interface, instructions, etc.I do not want to repeat many of the items listed in previous reviews which I agree with...however, I will add this...before jumping in, ask yourself, what am I really gaining here If you have a lot of complex remotes, sometimes it can take u days, maybe weeks to get this Harmony to do everything the current remote does. Then, even when it does, is the Harmony as intuitive as your existing remote Is the key layout ideal for the remote you use the most A good example is Directv DVR, their remote control is laid out in a very intuitive manner, it serves ONE purpose, and performs that one task very well. To make a Universal remote equally intuitive would be nearly impossible.Where I see these universal remotes as a good fit is... .multiple remotes that u use in sequence to switch between audio, video, input and output sources. These functions can be reduced to a single button on a universal remote such as this Ult. ONE. However, as others have correctly mentioned, don't even attempt to do a project like this in an hour or two....very unrealistic expectations, u really have to be a pit bull, a gadget master, goal oriented, type of person to make these devices the more complicated tasks. Not for those with ADD or who get frustrated easily. OTOH, if you have the time and nrg, are well versed at these types of techno projects....and u desire to simplify your multiple remote controls, this might be your dream remote control.",3.0,344,0.12177579365079373,0,13,1,0.03911210317460312,-0.03378756248993309,-1

"Harmony Ultimate One ReviewA few weeks ago I received and then responded to an E-Mail/survey from Logitech (It pays to register your products!). To make a long story short although I am not a professional reviewer, they chose to give me a Harmony Ultimate One universal remote to test and review as a customer (how cool is that). Anyway, regardless of how I got my hands on this unit, I promise an honest review, so here it goes:Ease of SetupWhen I received the Ultimate One (I'll refer to it as the U1 for the remainder of the review), I had already been familiar with the My Harmony website, where I had set up the U1's predecessor the Harmony Touch. Just like that endeavor, setting up the U1 on the website was as simple as can get. You're walked through each step beginning with finding your components on their HUGE database (I had no trouble finding all my gear), then arranging your activities (e.g. watch TV, listen to a CD, play a video game, etc.) and finally synching everything together to make it work. The bigger and more complex your system, the longer it may take you to set up the remote, but the ease of it all remains the same. Using the website to set up the remote is a trouble free and actually pleasurable experience. SCORE: 5 out of 5Ability to CustomizeThe U1 allows for some pretty cool customization. For one example, you can upload jpeg photos for icons. So, in theory, if you took a digital photo of yourself, you can use that picture as an icon to watch TV (the inner geek in me loves this stuff)! Aside from that, you can change background colors, change the name of an activity (like changing watch TV to Living Room TV), adjust the touch screen brightness, etc. One cool feature is that you can adjust the brightness of the back-lit hard buttons independent from the touch screen (nice). You can even choose how you want the unit to provide tactile vibration feedback when you press a touch screen button/icon (also a nice touch). On the down side, if you're into animated menus and icons, you won't find any here. SCORE 4.5 out of 5Performance/Ease of UseThe simplicity of the U1's setup transferred to its use. Logitech seems to get everything right off the bat. After listing my gear and arranging my activities, everything works perfectly. I don't know how they do it, but the delay times, sequence of power on/input choice, etc... was perfect. If for some reason it isn't, you can always adjust as needed. For TV viewing, Logitech Harmony provides 50 favorite channels, which show up as Icons on your U1. So, if you program HBO HD into your favorites, simply press the appropriate Icon to get that channel. The best part is, the Icon's, along with the corresponding channel numbers, are selectable from Logitech's impressive database (simple as can get). Being that this is an IR remote (with good line of sight coverage), if you accidentally move away while turning your components on, or off, causing a part of your system not to respond to IR commands, simply activate the help feature. The U1 will guide you through all of your components, ensuring that each one is on and the appropriate inputs are engaged in your display device/receiver/switcher. SCORE 5 out of 5ErgonomicsMuch has been written about the transport buttons located on top of the U1's predecessor, the Touch. They are still there on the U1, however, the fast forward and rewind buttons perform double duty: keep your finger pressed on either and you can skip/go back to the next/previous Blue Ray, DVD or CD chapter or track (I Like!). The vibrate feature (when you hit a touch screen Icon) and the auto-on based on motion, are HUGE improvements over the Touch, in my opinion. I don't know if Logitech meant for it to be handled this way, but concerning the aforementioned transport buttons on top of the remote... I find that it's easier to manipulate them with my forefinger than thumb. The backside of the remote has a more tactile friendly feel (like very light sandpaper). The front touch screen, surrounded by the hard buttons nestled onto the remote, is quite attractive. The non-contact areas finished in piano-gloss black add to the fit and finish. SCORE 4 out of 5ValueIt's hard to assign a value rating on consumer electronics. In my opinion, one must decide: Does it make my life easier Does it make my life more enjoyable If the answer to both of those questions is yes, then what's an appropriate price for such bliss At 249.99, the U1 isn't cheap however, for a home theater nut like me...its value is awesome! Would I recommend this remote for someone with just a flat panel and cable box Absolutely not! There are far less expensive options out there for that. Now, if money is absolutely no object and you asked me...I would say yes! However, I would also wonder why you don't have a more advanced, complex system. For the Home Theater enthusiast (like me...), the U1 is a very good value. After spending literally thousands (over the years) on Home Theater equipment, 249.99 is indeed a good value. SCORE 4.5 out of 5Plus and minusesPlus: Incredibly easy set up and use. Gesture capability with customization. Can control 15 devices. Comes with charger and one year warranty! Vibrate command option. Motion control backlight. Fifty channel favorites with appropriate Icons.Minus: The infamous transport buttons located above the touch screen. Price for simple systems may not be a value. You cannot replace the rechargeable battery.Final ThoughtsGet this remote! If you have components hidden away in cabinets or out of the direct line of sight for infrared, then purchase the Harmony Hub (about 100.00). I use it in my home theater and it works beautifully. However, as a standalone remote, the U1 has pretty good range for IR (as did its predecessor, the Touch). If you have more than a flat panel and a cable box, this remote should be at the top of your list. You will be able to set it up quickly and be able to use it efficiently.

"My experience with this remote has been nothing but a joyous one. The setup on their website was not only easy, but actually fun for me. It was a four step process (add components, add activities, add your favorite channels, and one more I'm forgetting). Setting up my favorite channels took me the longest, but I'm super organized, so I was moving channels around and going through all of my channels.The customization possibilities with this remote seems endless. When there were buttons that were either missing or didn't do what I wanted, it was super easy to either add a whole new button/functionality (by simply pointing my old remote at my Harmony and teaching my Harmony the new button) or edit a current button.You can edit graphics as well, such as the background or your favorite channel icons. I also created a Sequence (basically a macro), which worked perfectly fine - my sequence was watch in 3D which, while in my Watch a Movie activity, had about 4 steps of using my TV's 3D function. I even added a delay of 3 seconds before a couple actions (such as waiting for a screen to fully display before the Exit action was selected).Customizing this remote does require SOME technical skills, but that's expected with this remote, I think. It is pricey, but for what it does and how it's already programmed for each of my components, I think I got my money's worth.If I had to nitpick, it's not as easy as it should be to connect the sync cable to the remote. And also, it'd be much nicer if it was bluetooth instead of having to connect a cable to sync.I replaced 5 remotes and it works great for all:Sharp TV: LC-80LE844UYamaha receiver: RX-V473Sony Blu-ray player: BDP-BX57DVR receiver: Motorola VIP1216Xbox 360And I'll soon be adding Xbox OneI have a Wii U, but this remote won't work with that, which is fine, because I use Xbox for media streaming.Overall, I highly recommend this remote for anyone with the same needs as me!",5.0,341,0.13353146853146858,1,16,1,0.4332342657342657,-0.034718983114326196,-1
"I have owned Harmony remotes since long before Logitech bought out the company.I have lived with the knowledge that each remote would only last about 3 years before some form of button failure would develop, but it was worth it because no other remote on the market had the ergonomics and feature base and ease of setup of a Harmony remote.My fifth and best remote was a 900 and it was a fantastic remote until the volume and channel buttons started to fail at the young age of only 2 1/2 years.So I went out and bought a Harony Ultimate One at Best Buy and man oh man did I regret that! First of all has Harmony completely forgotten why remotes like the 1000 where failures and remotes like the 900 and the orginal Harmony One where great success stories Yes Harmony it was the BUTTONS and the right mixture of LCD that made the remote a must have. With the Ultimate you have too much LCD and not enough hard buttons. With LCD buttons you have to constantly look down at the remote when trying to do anything! With Physical buttons you can feel your way around the remote. Anyone who uses a remote for 2-3 weeks will become very use to finding most of the needed buttons without ever looking down once at the remote. With Touch screen buttons you can use it for years and you will still need to look down to see if your finger is over the right spot.Now while I am not happy towards the lessening of physical buttons and the leaning towards touch screen, I knew what I was getting into so I was willing to live with that until hopefully Harmony realized the mistake and made a more button packed remote like the 880, 900. But then acame the problems, it was like the remote had a built in Gremlin that just messed with it every so often. I dealt with lockups galore, problems with the LCD light staying on and killing the batteries and then prgogramming issues that I never had with any harmony remote before. In the end I packed up this puppy and sent her back.The real shame of all of this is that Harmony put the words Ultimate on this remote when in fact they have had so many better models over the years. Lesson for Harmony is go back to basics and give the customers what they want, not what is cheapest to build. This remote finaly crossed the line and got into the realm of low quality with too much glitz and sparkle and not enough of what once made Harmony remotes great.",2.0,448,0.08408820346320348,2,15,1,0.14204410173160176,-0.08125334267447326,-1
"Very good remote, controls all my devices - Samsung TV, Benq projector, Marantz AV amp, Sky HD, and PS3 (with an infra-red dongle - if you don't have one of these, this model can't control it, and same for PS4, apparently as it requires Bluetooth), even a couple of obscure old gadgets are still supported. Even if the device is not in the database, you can still learn commands from the original remote as a last resort.I like the harmony remotes because of the Activity concept. One button can, for example, turn on the TV, receiver and Blu-Ray player and set all the inputs to the correct setting ready to watch, while turning off unused devices. The more gadgets you have, the more benefit you get from a device like this.This was an upgrade/replacement for an old model Harmony 525, and while I like this well enough, it is more complicated in use than the old model.General build quality is very good, much better than the older model, it feels sold and weighty in the hand. The rounded back makes it easy and comfortable to hold, but it wobbles around on the coffe table. The remote slides easily into the charging dock, and as the 525 used to chew through batteries, this is much better. However, the battery in the remote is not easily replaceable, so I hope it has reasonable longevity.The feel of the backlit hard buttons is very good, with a nice positive click, much better than the old dead flesh rubber buttons on the 525.The D-pad and navigation buttons are well placed and easy to use, but the main play/pause/FF/RW controls are a bit awkwardly placed, but still useable.The touch screen display provide customisable soft buttons and obviously conveys much more information than the tiny monochrome LCD on the old model, but as it is a capacitive type, like a smartphone, it is very sensitive and easy to hit the wrong soft-key. The remote beeps and vibrates when a touch screen button is used, but it's not as positive as a real button and you have to look at the remote - you can't navigate by feel.Fortunately the touch screen is used mostly for secondary functions, and the hard keys cover the typical primary controls. Number keys are only touch-screen buttons and therefore more difficult to use than real buttons, but favourite Sky channels can be shown as a colourful page of icons, which is easier than remembering the channel number. However, to be honest, if you are like me you use the Sky Guide page anyway, which only needs the direction pad to navigate. To be fair after a few weeks, I really have put away all the original remotes as I don't need them, so this device does the job.The programming software is pretty easy to use, a bit quirky in some ways, but since I was used to the old version, I found it easy enough, and the new version is an improvement. Also, unlike the old 525 model, a certain amount of customisation can be done directly on the remote without using a PC at all. You can do a basic set up in a few minutes, but you will probably need a couple of hours to set it up perfectly of you have several devices to control.",4.0,555,0.1635232683982684,0,14,1,0.21823836580086586,-0.06155171451978847,-1
"This one is up in the air, it seems like a good but it doesn't seem well executed. I've basically used all Harmony remotes each with very minimal issues (tweaking settings) but nothing a little programming and a sync couldn't fix. All with the exception of the Elite model, it's very tempting but the price is not premium I want to fork over if it ends up like the Ultimate One model. this is a nice remote and a bit of a conundrum in itself with other issues. The layout and ergonomics are not pleasing to hold and use, although I can use the top video controls (play, pause, rewind, FF, etc.) I rest my middle finger and index finger between the little fin on the bottom, still a klutzy feel. I've been using this for about two week, I'm working with it. I had to setup the swipe lock for the screen because my palm wrecks my entire viewing experience with just a light brush of skin to screen contact. The ability to fully customize the pages would be nice, other than changing a background picture adding and deleting favorite channel icons.The make it or break it part, when I return it will be because of the activities I set up. It's getting old when you switch between activities and one or more component either responds when it shouldn't or doesn't respond at all. My programming is right, I have or currently use at least three of the lower tier remotes. It's frustrating for over 200 dollars, a 40-50 dollar pricetag wouldn't burn me so much. This Ultimate One remote has problems pretty much all the time. Once, a message popped up and told me a sync error, it was hung up for thirty minutes. The message told me to unplug/plug the remote and restart sync, it took maybe two minutes after that. I do it now each time it gets hung up for more than ten minutes I unplug it and restart the sync, two minutes and I'm fixed for that moment. I'll use my 350's, 650 and 700 remotes because it's beginning to look like those are my only reliable options.This is a nice remote, but everything I mentioned above will cut its lifespan short in my home. I desperately would love to try the Elite model but don't want to deal with another letdown. I've heard that customer service is mostly overseas, that's lovely when you need help on a complicated, technical device. Always a pleasure. The 12 month warranty is a little scary as well, 2 days out of warranty, we can't help you. These (all) companies are consistently cheapening materials and other components, making customer service lousy so everybody will give up and go fork out more money for replacements. I'll go back to using the individual component remotes. I'm still up in the air about this remote. Again I would love the Elite model but 367 days later and it bites the dust, I would not be very happy.",3.0,506,0.08246811224489796,0,14,1,0.058765943877550963,-0.05858238167355023,-1
"We bought this remote to replace our Harmony 650. All in all, this is a good remote. If I could, I'd rate 3.5 stars, but I rounded up.The good: Can handle more devices/activities than the 650. The touch screen is clean and responsive, but not overly sensitive so you don't have to worry about accidently launching a command while swiping. Scrolling up/down or side/side is a breeze. It has the most commonly used hard buttons available, so you can perform many functions without needing to look at the remote. Has an internal battery and comes with a charging stand.The bad: It doesn't have a very fluid design at all, nor is it easy to grip if you're trying to use the dvr/dvd controls at the top of the remote. Not sure why they went away from a more traditional remote design, but this was really bad decision making by Logitech.The remote is also kind of slow during the power on phase of various activities. Ex: I use the Watch TV activity to power on my tv/satellite receiver/theater and the remote stays in the starting mode for a good 15-20 seconds, so you can't immediately change to the channel you want or adjust volume until the remote finishes it's cycle. And you need to keep the remote pointed at your devices until they all power on. First world problems for sure, but the 650 didn't do that.Activities don't work once they've been activated. Ex: Using the Watch TV activity to power on my devices, let's say the theater doesn't power up. With the 650, I could just hit the Watch TV button a 2nd time and it would power the theater on without powering off the tv and satellite receiver. Not the case here. You have to go to the Help screen and once it turns your receiver on, it turns everything else off. Very frustrating when this happens.Battery life isn't that great. I get about 3 days between charges. Maybe I'm expecting too much, but I expected to be able to go at least a week. Good news is it only takes about 30 to fully charge.The touch screen has a swipe to unlock feature. I guess this is great if I'm worried about a stranger seeing what my favorite channels are, but it just seems kind of pointless.Most of the shortcomings for this remote are pretty minor, buy there's a lot of minor shortcomings which is what keeps me from giving a better rating. I don't hate the remote at all. Overall I'm happy with it, but it seems like Logitech tried to literally break the mold with this remote and came up short. If they made a remote that was basically the 650 but with a touch screen, they'd have the perfect remote imo.",4.0,466,0.13563888888888892,0,11,1,0.2321805555555556,-0.0264449563887742,-1
"After owning a Logitech 550, and then the One, and neither lasting for more than a couple years, I decided to give Logitech one more chance when I bought the Smart Control model (non-Ultimate) on a Black Friday deal. My biggest complaint with both models was that after a couple short years (or less), they just did not seem to work as well - either signals became weaker, or macros got corrupted, not sure...but especially considering the cost of the One, I was not impressed with the durability.Enter the Smart Control (not Ultimate) model, which I finally ponied up for after getting so frustrated with the One, where the range seemed to deteriorate over time, which is just amazingly frustrating. The Smart Control to me, represented the pinnacle of the line to date, until I was able to review the Ultimate, which resolves pretty much every complaint I have about the non Ultimate version.Make no mistake, both are great, but the Ultimate IMO, really is worth that extra cost due primarily to the following differences:1. Ultimate adds the touch screen of course, which solves the problem of having to use a phone to fix issues (automated help when the macros don't do what is expected), but of course also gives you access to all the detailed functions missing on the simple remote included with the non-Ultimate model.2. Charging station. I really liked this about the One, and I guess due to having a screen, it's more crucial to have this than with the non-Ultimate version, which does not include a station. It's also just a good place to keep the remote so I always know where it is.3. Backlit keys. Seemingly small thing, but for me personally, this is a HUGE deal, and one of the biggest reasons I prefer the Ultimate over the non-Ultimate.4. Haptic feedback and tilt sensor. Again, small things, but both add to the advantage of the Ultimate. They are nice to have' features that really helps the Ultimate get that extra nod over the non-Ultimate.And of course, the success of both of these remotes is the Smart Hub, IMO. Even if you aren't sitting far away, or have devices in wall, or behind cabinets, this hub I think is the real key to the success over the previous models like the One and its predecessors. So nice to not have to worry about PS3 integration, not to mention the success rate of the macros working properly has increased to probably 95 (I would say about 50 for the One)Overall, the Ultimate One represents years of development and tweaking, and IMO, has resulted in an excellent remote to top the line.Can't recommend enough, if you can get past the spendy price, but I really don't see any other alternatives in the market with this kind of functionality at this price point.",5.0,475,0.09688775510204081,0,18,1,0.4515561224489796,-0.07789929674491158,-1
"I put together a new entertainment system in 2012. A big jump (for me) with AV receiver, DVR, Blu Ray, Apple TV and flat screen. (Ordered from Amazon and very satisfied.) Even though I feel pretty comfortable with most tech and gadgets, I paid for Geek Squad to set everything up, and for me, this was worth it. When done, they went over the Harmony 890 remote with me, and I was great, until it stopped working. Volume button worn out (I think) so I researched and thought the upgrade would be OK, and I'd give setting it up a try.Wrong. The app that controls this had been upgraded, so that had to be done. An additional step of some silverlight software had to be installed also (why couldn't they have included that step for me) The software allows for transferring settings, which seemed great, until it didn't really include all steps. Guess I was going to learn how to set this remote up after all. But then, I realized that this unit would not work with the RF from my older 890. This is on me - I should've researched a bit more.So now, am I gonna spend more money, on an overpriced item to upgrade to their hub Nope. I will try to find a used or refurbished 890 that will work with my current RF extender and all the settings are working. The 890 does everything I want it to. It has enough flexibility to suit me, and is a huge improvement over multiple remotes.I don't upgrade my entertainment system that often. If down the road I need to update, I will find a teenager or use Geek Squad and avoid tremendous frustration. I've wasted close to 6 hours trying to get this to work, and it is clearly beyond my ability. As I look back on the reviews, many of the favorable commenters mention is some way the complexity in setting these up. I really don't think this needs to be the case. I really believe that the process could be much easier than it is. I hope your experience is better than mine - that you set it up adequately the first time, that you're able to do it easily and quickly, and that it works the way you want it to work.",1.0,388,0.25445165945165943,0,25,1,0.42722582972582973,-0.07685980358056022,-1
"Like many Im a long time harmony user from the one to the 900 and now ultimate, ultimate one and the smart control.Todays smart tvs have netflix and amazon prime, plex, etc built right into their interface, thats where the second execution functions by holding down a button comes in handy with out having to set up a separate activity..i.e watch tv activity normally controls tv and cable box but netflix is built into tv interface. well you can program the netflix command to appear on the screen of the remote or the red color button or what ever button you choose and then use the long press command to use for the tv controls as the short press commands will most likely control the cable box since that is what the main use for that activity will be used for... the point is that todays smart tvs/ smart boxes etc require much more functionality than the old harmony remotes were best used for.many negative reviewers dont seem to put in the time or energy into looking into the possibilities of programming options that these remotes have, its almost endlesssequence commands are back and longer sequences are possible than with the harmony one. with a lil imagination can do anything you wantcommand delays come in handy for devices with long boot up timestouch screen sensitivity can be adjusted for the accidental touchesyou can program the play/pause/rewind/ff/skipahead/skipback as secondary commands on the directional pad if you don't like the default buttons being on top of the remote as many complain aboutyou have the ability to leave certain activities on when changing other activities and will ONLY turn off when pressing the power button...i.e. play xbox 360 activity can be set to leave on if you want to take a break but not loose your spot in game to watch a tv. (i only mention this because it seems like teenagers are the ones who complain about this feature most with out researching enough).so although I understand how diehard harmony one fans may not like new remote, you have to realize that there is more potential with these remotes than before. I have swapped out 3 harmony ones and one 900 to 2 harmony ultimates, one ultimate one, and 2 smart controls...(smart control is my favorite remote).",5.0,385,0.13898648632691188,0,3,1,0.43050675683654405,-0.01844674454167816,-1
"Bought this remote because of other people in my family - they were unable to operate the TV with the sound system with the streaming player with the DVD player. I would get phone calls at work - what input what box HDMI which remote is for thatThis remote allows you to power on what you want and set the right inputs with one button. When it works - it's great.You can control individual devices AND you can make Activities happen. For example:Watch Netflix - turns on my TV sets it to HDMI1, Turns on the sound bar and sets it to DVD Turns on the DVD player (which also streams my Netflix).You can also go even further and have the DVD remote go right a selection, and okay so the actual Netflix app pis selected. This part is a bit more finicky because it depends at what point the DVD starts up - if it doesn't always start up at the same place it would go right a selection and okay to the wrong app. Hope that made sense!Other features:You can add an icon to the activity you createYou can individually program buttons to what you want when in a certain activity, e.g. a short press can do something on the DVD player, while a long press can do something else on the sound barWhy I'm knocking stars off:For some reason that I haven't quite figured out, things don't ALWAYS turn on when they are supposed to or inputs don't go to the right input (It goes to HDMI2 when its supposed to be HDMI1). These errors maybe happen 10 of the time - but still wish they wouldn't happen at all! Because then I'll get a phone call!Next to the favorites button and the home button - I wish there was a devices button where it would go to your options of which device you want to control. Right now you can do that, but you have to go through a not so obvious way. Which REALLy sucks when its my family members trying to figure out how to control a certain device. And since certain devices don't turn on, it would have been great if it it were easy to just power on the TV with the Logitech.",4.0,381,0.10999278499278499,3,18,1,0.2450036075036075,-0.06571262099414277,-1
"Not happy at all with this remote. I had the previous model, the Harmony One, and I loved it. Bought one for my sister and my parents as gifts and programmed theirs in addition to mine. Old version was easy to program and use. I mistakenly thought this would be even better. Here is what I do not like about it (and if this is something I programmed incorrectly and someone knows how to fix it, feel free to advise)1. As I said I programmed all the others, so I don't think I am too bad at it, but I have not been able to get this one to work consistently yet. I am always having to use the help button because the TV wont turn on/off.2. Way slower to do all the steps.3. Help button is not right out in the open like it was previously.4. I have not yet been able to figure out how to make the home screen for my roku come up without having to hit the home button. I get a blank screen.5. It does not tell me when the battery is getting low (the old version did).6. Can't figure out how to make the keypad my default home page for TV instead of favorites channels.7. Pretty much every time I update it I have to reset it, it stops halfway through the update.There are things I like better though,1. A fix it myself option2. the DVR button brings up my DVR listing, I don't know if that was true before or not.Sure wish they would bring back the old model, I'd buy it in a minute. I can't see my parents using this one easily so I hope theirs does not break anytime soon.",1.0,291,0.14561904761904768,0,24,1,0.37280952380952387,-0.025353859242121746,-1
"What a joke. Because you can't change the way this thing insists on turning EVERY device on and off every time you change Activities it is completely worthless for my pretty simple system. My receiver takes several seconds (about 10) to come on and won't accept commands from the remote before it is booted up (which Logitech should know). So when I use the canned activity Watch TV , the receiver ends up on the wrong input every time because the Harmony is trying to change it before the receiver is ready. No problem, I think, I can add a pause in between the the power on and change input commands, right WRONG, when you go into the customize activity section, the built in functions are starred and it explicitly states that you cannot change the default actions, only add to them. Okay, maybe I can leave the receiver off of the Watch TV program... But then I can't control the volume... Okay, maybe there's a way to just tell it to use the receiver volume all the time.... Back over to the customize section.... Nope. Okay, maybe I'll create a totally custom, Watch TV but then the Favorites won't work, man that's like half the reason I bought this 250 remote... Oh and it still doesn't handle the power (the most basic function of any piece of equipment) correctly so that doesn't solve anything. Oh and by the way, the software to load the settings to the remote crashes about one in five time you you use it which bricks the remote and you have to a soft reboot (hold the off and menu keys down for 20 seconds). And so begins a cascading set of compromises that ultimately renders the Logitech Harmony One a very INCAPABLE universal remote. not even as good as one that can be ordered from this very site for about 20. I've played with this thing for a week and the only way I can make any use of it is to use the individual devices means of controlling things (like that good old 20 universal one). But becaeuse Logitech makes the cool features, like the Favorites dependent on their notion of Activities none of that works for me. Oh, and when you're looking at the touch screen for individual devices, The button descriptions take up the whole screen sooyou can only see 3 or 4 buttons at a time, making that pretty much worthless too. Well just the icons would do, maybe I can get rid of the descriptions... Back over to the customize section, you can change the label, but it can't be blank and you still only get one button per line..... You see where this is going. Do yourself a favor and stick to the 20 model.",1.0,467,0.03667027417027418,0,14,1,0.3183351370851371,-0.02875634179976916,-1
"Dog ate my Harmony One Advanced remote - it was a great remote!This one, the Ultimate One IR Remote, is not nearly as stable or useful as the original. The touch screen is touchy and cranky. It is VERY sensitive to the angle and pressure you use to activate functions frequently selecting channels you didn't... No matter how many times I program it - it continues to confuse the BD (BlueRay) and TV/SAT (Dish) selections - requiring either the Help button or a manual input to make the desired selection. It is slower in executing commands than the original (I hope Logitech Management reads this). However, it works (mostly) and is better than a side table full of disparate remotes.EDIT: 22 September 2014 - Still have to keep a couple of the old device-specific remotes handy. For example the Ultimate One does not mirror all controls of my Panasonic BD Player...once in a while I have to use the original remote for accessing all the settings or functions. Battery life is a joke - a couple of days off the charger and it dies. The more I use the Ultimate One the more I dislike the nameless engineer who designed this mediocre excuse for a Universal remote. I have downgraded the original 3-Stars to a more appropriate 2-Stars.EDIT: 12 December 2014 - DO NOT BUY THIS FRUSTRATING, POORLY DESIGNED GARBAGE! Thinking maybe a firmware update could help with this device's erratic stability problems I went to the Logitech site. This piece of junk is no longer even mentioned or carried on the site. The Ultimate One form-factor is non-existant. Poof! Gone away! When a manufacturer will not acknowledge one of their products then you should RUN away from purchasing it.

"I'm a long time Harmony remote user. This will be the 4th model/upgrade I've had, with the most recent being the Harmony One. My understanding is that this remote is similar to the Harmony Touch, and Identical to the remote in the Harmony Ultimate package (with the IR Hub).The big possible deal breaker here is the lack of a physical number pad. I realize that can be a deal breaker for some people, but it's an obvious change and you know what you're getting in that regard.The device itself feels very well built. I like the ergonomics, but that's a matter of opinion of course. Aside from the physical number pad, you are short a couple of physical buttons that appear on some other models, but in exchange you have the wonderful feature of being able to assign a long and short press to each physical buttons (distinguished by a nice haptic feedback), allowing you to set a great deal of commands. The other great feature compared to my previous remote, is the ability to add and remove commands, and rearrange the screen on the device itself, without having to connect to a PC. You still need to sync to a PC to change the physical buttons, but it's still a welcome addition.The tilt sensor, which wakes the device when you pick it up, is also much more sensitive and functional than my old Harmony One, which almost required a shake. A small thing, but again nice.Some complain about the media controls (play, FF, RW, etc) being at the top of the remote. I don't find it that much of an issue. Plus, the touchscreen allows you to set EXTREMELY helpful gesture commands (which again can be setup from the device itself). The options for gestures are:TapDouble TapSwipe LeftSwipe RightSwipe UpSwipe DownSwipe Left and holdSwipe Right and holdSwipe Up and holdSwipe Down and holdSo by simply assigning swipe left and right as FF and RW, and tap as Play/Pause, you have a nice alternative if the button layout bothers you. But again, I find the physical key positions are easy to get used to.Lastly, there are the usual customization features, most of which are either implemented better, or at least more easily than previous models, such as custom screen wallpapers, customer activity icons (unavailable on the Harmony one), etc..All in all, while the ergonomics and on screen number pad may be a bit unusual at first, it's a fantastic remote. Go and pick up and hold one in person at a store if possible, so you know what it feels like. But function wise, it's exactly what you'd expect if you have experience with Harmony remotes in the past.Oh, one last thing, the Battery isn't replaceable. Never a great product decision in my mind, but I had my Harmony One for almost 5 years and it still held a charge for several days without issue, so i'm not overly concerned. The battery also doesn't last quite as long as my old Harmony one, possibly due to the larger screen.. but for me that means about 2 or 3 days, instead of 5 or 6, which is not really an issue.So in summary, I've previously loved each Harmony remote I've owned more than the last. This case is a little different though. My last Harmony was definitely an incredible remote and each of my previous remotes were definite improvements over each other. However, in this case I'd say this one is less of an objective improvement, and more of a change or alternative style in remotes. There are a few extra features for sure. But just looking at the physical remotes and their core functionality, I'd say that the Harmony Ultimate remotes and the old Harmony One are equal and it would come down to preference (mostly in regards to the feel of the buttons and the ergonomics.)",5.0,647,0.11976893187830688,0,14,1,0.4401155340608466,-0.08290521077658963,-1

"I negotiated one of these directly from Logitech as a replacement for a Harmony One that developed the swelling battery issue and became dangerous to use. At first Logitech refused to replace, but I was persistent and it paid off.My review follows:I have only had this unit for a few days, but so far I like it. It's a completely different concept than their old remotes. The software is new, and you program for your area and you service provider. So far so good.My first issue was, my zip code. About 4 years ago, the USPS, in it's infinite wisdom changed my zip code. Four years later, Logitech hasn't yet caught up. When I entered my zip code, nothing. Then, on a whim, I entered my old zip code, one that doesn't exist anymore, and bingo, it was recognized.The programming from there was tedious but pretty easy. Te remote allows you to select up to 50 of your favorite channels, and you chose them from a touch screen using icons that identify the channel and also shows the channel number. You can also arrange these icons in any order you want. The icons are small, and some are hard to read. What this means to me is, that I no longer have to use DirectTVs Channel Guide to locate the channel number, and then enter that on a keypad on the remote. I simply scroll on the touch screen until I find the channel I want and tap. The remote has made a few mistakes, but generally it's pretty good and choosing the correct channel. It does save time. There is also the option of a numeric touch screen for those instances where you want to enter a numeric number. I don't think I will be using the numeric key pad much. Also, during the programming, there was an instance where Logitech's software hadn't picked up the complete channel lineup, but there is a provision that allowed me to manually enter it, albeit with a generic icon. So far it works for me.As a final thought, as I mentioned earlier, this was a replacement for a Harmony One that had a swelled battery and had become dangerious to use because of excessive heat coming from the remote. The battery in the Harmony One is in a nacelle and once it starts to swell, it's impossible to remove, I know I tried. I also have a Harmony 880, that battery had also started to swell, but the battery is mounted in a conventional way, and it was easily changed. I guess Logitech is worried about this going forward, because the battery in the Ultimate One is NOT, that's right, is NOT replaceable. The instructions say that when the unit reached end of life Who knows when that is You dismantle (destroy) the unit and remove the battery for disposal.I don't believe this is the proper solution on an electrical item that has a list price of 250.00.",4.0,496,0.0190353207398662,0,19,1,0.290482339630067,-0.07914390004896232,-1
"This works nicely and has enough adjustments that it can be made to replace probably any remote you have. But you have to consider several things before buying:It takes a while to set up you need patience. But you should have to set it up only once.The touch screen is small and unless your fingers are very small, it can be very clumsy to use.You have to use two hands to operate the remote for most functions.Support is willing but not very knowledgeable--put another way, it does not pass the Turing Test.The design has a variety of other quirks that will matter to some and not to others.For example, I, like a number of other folks, wrote in that the backlight for the buttons turns back on after the unit had been on the charger or a while.After a week dealing with Support, during which time I was told the problem would be fixed and I was told to reset, reboot, update firmware (which was already the latest version), create new accounts, re-setup the units from scratch, provide additional info and was given incorrect instructions on how to change settings, and then I was told that the problem was bumped up to the next higher level of Support, after all that I was told that the behavior is a nomral function, that the backlight is supposed to come on after the unit has been on the charger for a few hours.It took a week for support to figure out that the behavior was normal function What kind of management does not supply Support with with proper information or provides it with believable answers.It of course WAS NOT normal function and the programmers corrected the issue in a subsequent firmware update--but no thanks to the Support contractor--thanks go instead to the Logitech Technician that was watching the Logitech forums.If you can live with all that, and are well healed, this might be an effective way to cut down on all those remotes. You can Use the one remote in place of all the others, generally, without having to think about which settings to use. For example, if you want to watch TV The Harmony remembers which devices you have and howe they are setup/connected to each other and works accordingly.",4.0,379,0.0618285799168152,0,8,1,0.26908571004159243,-0.003920587611406345,-1
"I got it as a free replacement for a Harmony One that had an exploding battery. I thought great they are standing behind their product when I accepted it, but this is horrible. It's an ergonomic disaster. It actually takes two hands AND two eyes to use because it's so badly laid out. I don't get why they created two sets of buttons separated by the touch screen. I like the bottom feel and curve of the remote, but the top edges are too sharp and the nice fit to my palm is defeated by the fact that I need to move the remote up and down so I can reach the buttons. And I have pretty long fingers. Seriously, this is so awkward I don't think I'll use it much.2/11/15 UpdateDropped to 1 star as the product has a design defect. I noticed that the remote makes a fairly loud buzz when the backlight is on. So I called Logitech and their first response was to show me how to turn the button highlight off. That did work, but then you cannot see the buttons in the dark. Clearly this was a known issue. I kept saying that I wanted the backlight to work. After a few minutes delay she told me it was a known defect that engineering was working on. She would put my name on a list for replacement when they figured it out. I asked her to keep the ticket open until I received the replacement. She said OK. I repeated this again before hanging up and she said OK again. 2 minutes after hanging up I get an email that says since I've put your name on the list I'm closing this ticket. She could have told me the truth when I had her on the phone. Sigh. Cannot recommend this remote until they figure out their design flaw. My hearing is not great and it didn't really bother me that much, but my kids don't want to use it because the noise is so annoying.9/22/2015 UpdateEventually I contacted them again about the noise and they did send me a new remote that fixed the noise problem.

"I've been using this remote for about a year now, before that had a harmony one (which I miss, but we finally sat on it too many times and it broke)The good:I can use it to control my Apple TV, Tivo HD, Bluray player and receiver with ease.

The touchscreen is too slow and doesn't feel responsive compared to a smartphone.The gestures are completely useless for controls.You have to swipe several times to get the to software keyboard.The setup software was a pain in the ass to get going. It used silver lite or some plugin in a browser. It would have been better as a native app. The software menus were confusing and some features seems exclusive when they shouldn't have been. I couldn't program a tivo button and something else. I had to get the tivo remote and program it as a custom button.The button signals are also too slow. I was able to shorten them in the software program, but only for favorite channel buttons. Turning things off from my TV mode takes 15 seconds or so, doesn't sound like much but feels like forever pointing it at the screen.While I could change speed of the favorite buttons punching in the numbers, I couldn't get it fast enough. I think the min time between presses was 200ms or something. I feel like I can punch in the numbers faster on my Tivo remote, if I wanted too. I should be able to make this faster but I couldn't in the software.Overall, if you have the money, get the Harmony remote with the hardware buttons (it cost 2X what this one does).

"I am usually not one to leave a review, but for this remote I feel I have to. The only reason I am giving it one star is because I have to in order to leave a review. This is my 3rd logitech harmony remote. My first 2 were the Harmony 900, which I think is an excellent remote. Unfortunately I have had to replace due to small children breaking the touch screen. The Ultimate one remote is terrible!! They have a good idea by trying to make everything a touch screen. However, they have done away with the numbers on the remote. The only way to access them is through the touch screen. Good Luck with That!! It will at least take a person SEVERAL attempts to enter the numbers without any hick-ups (and I have a great connection). They also have an option where one can assign their favorite channels to a simple touch icon. Good luck with That!! That also takes several attempts. I understand the concept but it doesn't work. If you have a chance to buy the Harmony 900, buy it. The only positive I have has nothing to do with the remote. Logitech has upgraded the blaster, so that it connects to your wifi. It is nice to run your TV from your phone. BUT it has its issues as well. I think this would be a great remote IF it had physical numbers to push on the remote. Hope this helps.

"I've been using a Harmony 880 for a bunch of years. Finally the buttons to select an activity and its associated controls started becoming intermittent and it was time to find something else. I looked at the Harmony Ultimate hub and its associated controllers WiFi, but the limit of 2 IR repeaters vs. my multiple drawer layout just wouldn't work for me. I finally settled on the Ultimate One (the drawers have glass fronts).I downloaded the new MyHarmony app - I'd been using the older Java app for years, but decided to give this one a try - especially since it claimed to be able to transfer from my old heavily customized 880 - and it did! About 95 of all the customized buttons came over. I needed to re-assign the color keys at the bottom, but that was easy to do.The one glitch I had was in setting up Favorites - I failed to notice that the Favorites also automatically invokes one of your activities (which would typically be 'Watch TV'). Unfortunately, that's not the one it defaulted to. After setting up all of the Favorites, I was wondering why it kept starting 'Watch DVR' when I touched a favorite - RTFM! The unpleasant part came when I could find no way to go back and change that without removing all of the Favorites (a call to Tech Support at 6PM EDT came back with a recording that TS was closed - please call back between 9AM and 10 PM !). Anyhow, after re-doing the setup everything was fine - except the channel logos were blurry and relatively ugly.Enter www.iconharmony.com - a great site for almost every channel logo imaginable. I downloaded some 35+ logos from them (and sent the author a little contribution via PayPal for his efforts) and uploaded those icons via MyHarmony. They look a whole lot better - I don't know why Logitech/Harmony can't start with them out of the box.Similarly, the activity icons could use some help - a quick Google search turned up lots of icon sites I downloaded new icons and re-sized them to 70x70 using Photoshop, but there are a lot of apps that can resize images. You then upload them via MyHarmony.All in all, it took several hours worth of time at the computer - and that was with all of the activities and devices already defined from my 880. But at least part of that was my fault for not checking the Favorites Activity and then for wanting better-looking icons.The other thing I've noticed is that the Ultimate 1 seems to have a broader IR beam - I don't need to be quite as careful in aiming it as with the 880.As many others have commented, I also wish it had physical number buttons, but I've not found it that difficult to swipe the screen to get the number panel up. Similarly, the FF, Play/Pause buttons at the top haven't seemed to be such a nuisance as others have described - but I'm used to using 2 hands with the remote. I also found it easier to move (Menu-Edit) the Favorites icons around on-screen on the remote vs. on the app.Something that's a bit hidden away is the full device control - on the 880 you used the Devices button to bring up another screen which then gave you all of the learned device controls. On the Ultimate 1, you use the Menu-Devices to get you to a similar screen of devices, the to their detail controls.",5.0,588,0.05361008039579468,3,25,1,0.4731949598021027,-0.15132049870932995,-1

"Everyone in my family got tired of having 4-5 remotes to work our TV, DVD player, AppleTV, Sound system and a laptop.There was a lot of clutter, not to mention one or two were always disappearing. So I had a friend make a suggestion and he came up with this Logitech Harmony Ultimate One IR Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control (915-000224).First, let me say that even after using computers since their inception in the early 80's I wanted no part in even trying to set this up myself.I hired a guy who's in the wiring business of audio-video, telephones etc, and he set it up. He's a pro and eventually he did get it all working, but not before having to speak to tech support on more than one occasion. It seems there was a couple of known bugs but you never get that information on the first go round. Anyway, I can say that even the most challenged (technically) member of my family can use it. i.e. No more complaining. Now, I breeze through turning everything on and off with just one remote. I like the graphic interface and the ease of its use. I love the fact that you pick it up in a dark room and it lights up automatically so you can see the interface without having to push a button first. This is a really good product. In a sense it is a five star product, losing only one star for the set up issues.One other thing to add though, is that there are two parts to the system and, at first, I bought just the remote. I seemed to have missed the fact that you need both the IR Remote AND the Logitech 915-000238 Harmony Home Hub, so I had to buy the other part as well. Note that they are sold together as well as separately but if you buy them both in the same package, it is cheaper than buying them separately.",4.0,331,0.08199999999999999,0,14,1,0.259,-1.2953276175120543e-05,-1
"Have you ever noticed how a manufacturer can add embellishments to a beautiffuly designed product only to make the new and improved model more clumsy and and less efficient Well, that's exactly what has happened here. As an owner of the previous Harmony One (the remote without Ultimate in its name) I would have rated that model 5 stars. It sported several additional buttons to handle specific functions, and the buttons were larger, with different shapes and feel, and they were well laid out. The remote was a bit larger and heavier, but oh what a pleasure to use, whether with the built in backlighting or simply by feel. The Ultimate One by comparison has fewer buttons, thereby necessitating that some of them perform two completely different functions (a short press will perform a channel up or channel down function and a long press will move up or down one page of the on-screen channel guide. You'll be surprised and thoroughly annoyed by how many times you will perform one of those functions when you really meant to perform the other. In addition the buttons are tiny and pretty much the same size and shape, making it very easy to hit the wrong one. Case in point, the tiny mute button lives right below the Volume Down button. I'd like to have a dollar for every time my finger inadvertently hit mute when I was trying to reduce the volume of sound. I suppose the remote is called Ultimate because it is capable of responding to gestures similar to a computer tablet. The function is nice, but nowhere as efficient as a good set of buttons.The software used to set up the remote is not easy, especially for first time users. If you have previous experience with setting up and using home theater equipment as well as computers you should be able to navigate the software, though not easily. If you lack experience with that equipment you'd probably be better of having someone set up the remote for you. Having said all this, I would be remiss if I didn't say that this remote, despite its serious shortcomings is hands down better than the 3 or 4 remotes you would have to use to control a good home theater system. We can only hope that with the next Logitech model, the company will learn from its successes and failures and return to a design similar to the Harmony One.",3.0,409,0.05785870610870611,0,5,1,0.07107064694564691,-0.012810015718385581,-1
"Disclaimer: I bought this at Best Buy instead of ordering it though Amazon. (Not that it should matter just saying)I'm a big fan of minimalist design so I thought I would love this remote. Unfortunately, the ergonomics and button placement are terrible. The guide, volume and pager buttons are in the worst possible place - you have to reposition your hand on the remote in order to press it. These buttons are used the most when watching tv they should be where the LCD is placed (or on the LCD). The lcd itself is centrally located but rarely used and isn't as responsive as a normal lcd screen on an iphone/samsung device. Logitech need to make up their mind - buttons or no buttons.My other issue is with the setup. You have to download and install a silverlight application (why silverlight) and register an account with harmony in order to program the remote. Your entire setup data is stored on logitech servers so that anyone looking into your account can see the devices you own and are using with this remote. Why can't I just have a universal remote that doesn't send information about the items in my house to another companyI was having an issue with the backlight making a high pitched noise when it was on. I called the support line and they told me to update the firmware - when it didn't go away the guy told me they have to escalate the issue to some other department. When I got off the phone I got an email saying my issue was resolved. I took the remote back the next day. They don't seem like a very customer oriented company - after 90 days they charge you 10 dollars to make a call to the support line if you are having issues even though they offer a year warranty on the device. I don't get it.I will say I liked the xbox integration but it wasn't worth the 200 dollar price point.",2.0,335,0.034285714285714274,0,12,1,0.1171428571428571,-0.017643590891358474,-1
"I'm sorry to say that I thought this remote was junk and am returning it after a few weeks of use. I know it looks tempting, I know it looks slick, it's certainly nicely packaged, but it's a horrible product.The number one thing a remote maker has to get right in my opinion is the ergonomics, feel and balance of the unit. Those of us that watch a lot of TV (for better or worse!) have this thing in our hands a lot of the time, and it needs to feel right. The Ultimate One fails immediately in this regard. The weight and balance is just off, making it awkward to use the touch screen and gestures, and the top buttons (which are actually used a lot when watching shows on DVR) feel uncomfortable and out of reach. The unit feels constantly as though it is tipping forward or back. It's hard to describe, but it just doesn't sit right. I have large hands, and my wife's hands are pretty small, but we both became very frustrated with this remote after trying to use it for a few weeks. The fuzzy material on the bottom of the unit is a bad choice too. I'm not sure whether it's trying to have a leather like feel, but it feels like I'm holding a loofah. I get it that everyone is different, but I really feel like Logitech (who really seems to be the only manufacturer making half-decent universal remotes) needs to go back to the drawing board. I just can't believe they tested this on humans before releasing it.Aside from the ergonomics, the buttons are not particularly satisfying, the touch screen is not particularly slick (I guess we are all spoilt from using iPhones / iPads), and I found more than once having to manually power on my cable box, despite having tuned the setup carefully and there being no obstructions between the remote and the device. I like the fine tuning ability that you have with Logitech's Harmony software, but it does seem unnecessarily complex sometimes. The remote update also seems to take an unnecessarily long time.I have absolutely no objection to paying 250 for a universal remote that does what it needs to do and feels good in the hand. However, this is not that remote. Not even close.Logitech, if you are listening, get a new design team. You can do better than this.We were replacing a Harmony One remote (discontinued) that became unreliable after a few years, but we decided to find a reconditioned one after sending this one back.Buyer beware.",1.0,433,-0.05004165645675081,1,12,1,0.27497917177162456,-0.05072437566099308,-1

"First of all let me say I never write reviews...good or bad. This product is so poorly thought out and overpriced that I was compelled to write this. Let me start by saying that I have used harmony remotes in the past and was completely satisfied with them. I thought my old Harmony One was a fantastic unit until I stepped on it and cracked the glass. That was that. Then I bought this new Harmony One expecting another great product. Aside from the fact that it was a new model of the Harmony One, I was drawn in by the new touch screen, smaller size and new design. The old one used hard buttons. Big mistake. I allowed myself to be sucked in. So, what's wrong with it First, the touch screen is way too sensitive. It seems to be activated simply by having a finger near the screen without, not by touching it. Secondly, the actual physical buttons are placed above the touch screen, making it very easy to change the channel or the function accidentally. Third, it's infrared beam (I don't even use the IR) is very focused and frequently does not control all components for a particular function (say watch TV) in sync. I could go on and on, but I think you get the idea. This thing costs between 300 and 400 dollars to boot. Well, the story has a happy ending. I recently found the old model Harmony One on Amazon for a pretty penny, but I have a lot of components in my system and this remote controls them all perfectly. One final word. Do Not Buy This Product! It is junk. You would be better off giving your hard earned money to charity. There! I finally got it off my chest.

"I never write reviews, but I felt I had to for this remote. I was the owner of a Logitech Harmony One for several years prior to purchasing this remote. I loved the One, it was reliable, easy to use, and felt nice in the hand. I have been using the Ultimate One for well a year now, and for the price this remote falls short.First was the set up. Logitech switched to a new program, so if you were coming over from a previous device you had to start from scratch. I feel that everything should have simply imported to the new program. This added a good amount of time to the set up. The remote itself looks great, and is lightweight. However, it does not feel as ergonomic as the One did. It is also lacking the number buttons, which makes quickly switching between several channels more time consuming than a traditional remote. You have to either scroll through the channels or go through the touch screen to find the channel icon you want.When it comes to functionality the remote really falls short. I purchased the 100 hub to control my PS3. The remote constantly loses its pairing with the system. I am them forced to get the PS3 controller and re-register the blu tooth device all over again. It defeats the entire purpose of the remote. It is also not uncommon for the remote and HUB itself to lose their pairing. Forcing you to either restart the HUB or connect the remote to a computer and reset it.The remote also has not had the ability to connect to a PS4 until recently, and it still can not turn the system on/off. If I still need to go to the system or use my PS remote, what is the use of the universal remote The remote also seems to incorrectly perform the start up or shut down of a process more frequently than my One did. Making me either press the help button, go into the devices and fix it myself, or physically get up and turn a component on of off.I would have given my One five stars to give you an idea of the step back this remote is. For the 350 I paid when it was new (including the HUB), this is a real let down.***Update 4/29/16***Somehow this remote has become even less functional. As noted above there is no easy way to change the channel with this remote. The icons are now completely useless. For example if I want to change to channel 44.1 I press the icon button because I do not want to scroll through 20 channels, and the on screen numbers do not work well. The first press will get me 4.1. Next 1, then 4.1, then .1, then 44. Finally I'm at a channel that I can just scroll to. Sometimes it never even gets close and I will just scroll through all the channels. I make sure to keep the remote pointed directly at the TV, and give it time between button presses but nothing works. I am changing my review to one star.",1.0,525,0.04000348310693137,0,26,1,0.32000174155346567,-0.10251954387293138,-1
"This remote, is the absolute stupidest and non functioning thing I have ever experienced. We have only had it for less than 8 months and the screen that has the numbers on it, does not appear, and the remote does not respond to many things. Also the screen never goes off like it used to, and it runs out of battery quickly and is annoying having to let it charge for minutes before it can change channels. It seeped so interesting and advanced when I first saw and used it, but now it also does not let me turn the TV on unless I hit off first (and it's already off). ALSO, I have to ALWYAS go to 'fix it myself' to change from TV to DVD, and the audio is always screwed up and never is synced to the right function, no matter how many times we have re-synced and fixed it, after 3 uses, it goes back to not functioning properly. Furthermore, the price for this pice of *garbage*, is overly priced and inflated, this remote is so bad that they should pay YOU to get it, because there is no such thing as giving them negative money, so, it would just be them giving you money to get their screw up remote. I can go on and on about all of the things completely horrible about this remote, but to save you the reading, short review is: THIS IS THE WORST REMOTE IN THE HISTORY OF REMOTES.This remote deserves NEGATIVE ratings, it's not even good enough for 1 star.",1.0,262,-0.0046130952380952425,0,21,1,0.29769345238095235,-0.009438109722767374,-1
"This is a quality product -- as it should be for the price. I bought it to replace a Harmony 680 that failed after six months of use. As compared to the 680, the buttons are far better: solid rather than spongy and, on the single-function buttons, a clear clicky feel (though silent) when acturated. I understand the complaints of users who prefer buttons over touch-screen controls or find it clumsy to operate with one hand, but neither is a concern for us. In fact, touch-screen control is very similar to a smartphone my somewhat technophobic wife found it easier to learn than the button-controlled 680.I'm using the unit without the hub, since we already have an IR integrator that controls all the devices from a single sensor under our wall-mounted TV. The IR output seems very strong and, unlike the standard Time Warner remote, doesn't have to be close to and aimed directly at the sensor.The device worked properly after the basic activity setup using the Windows software downloaded from the Logitech website. However, I soon discovered that it's even better after customization. Going beyond things like setting up favorite channels is not a job for the faint-hearted some computer expertise is needed. Also, the complete user manual should be downloaded from the Logitech website before attempting a more detailed customization.Unlike the 680, I found it unnecessary to add commands for the individual devices that were omitted from the basic setup. On the other hand, the ability to fine-tune the delay and switching times for each device was a big plus. With the 680, IR output continued for a much longer time than it took to activate the devices. This was a real nuisance. If, say the TV had been set at a high volume when it was turned off, and if a low volume was needed when turning it back on, I had to wait as much as 5 seconds with the TV blaring until I could access the volume control -- not good if someone was asleep in the next room.For me the need for a charging cradle is a plus. It sits on my nightstand next to the bed, is always handy and fully charged, and doesn't disappear into the bedding, onto the floor, into a nightstand drawer, or onto some other piece of bedroom furniture where I wouldn't think of looking for it.My only uncertainty about this remote is its longevity, which I can't comment on because it's still fairly new. I've used Logitech keyboards and trackballs for many years and have always found them very reliable. After the failure of my 680 I'm just a bit nervous and hoping for a better experience with the Ultimate One.",5.0,453,0.08344549390003937,0,14,1,0.45827725304998035,-0.04635123933521301,-1
"Prior to this remote, I owned a Harmony 785 which was a fantastic remote and has only been replaced by the Harmony Ultimate One as it is now getting to the point where we have simply worn it out from years of use - buttons getting hard to press, physical wear, etc.The Ultimate One has given me a couple of headaches. The most annoying problem is that often after making a change in the My Harmony app, the software very often throws an error telling me it cannot load the changes from the remote. Let me explain this - unlike older models, there are some limited changes you can make on the remote itself. In order for the software to keep these changes, it must first download them from the remote before up-loading the changes you have made in My Harmony so that they don't get lost.At this point, My Harmony just stops in its tracks and I cannot update changes. The ONLY way I have found to fix this is to perform a factory reset on the remote. This will get it to the point that I can now upload the new settings to the remote, but if I had made any changes on the remote itself, they would be lost. Fortunately for me, I don't make changes on the remote, so I get away with it. Logitech support have no solution for me other than to do what I'm doing - factory reset. This makes updating the remote a real chore that I don't look forward to.I also miss the physical buttons from the older Harmony remotes that are now only available on the touch screen (number keys, etc.) and the skip forward/back and fast forward/back keys that have been merged into one set of keys.Once programmed up, the remote actually performs as you would expect - starts up your components properly and controls everything correctly. I just find the user experience lesser than it was with the older models. Logitech seems to have taken a backward step somewhere along the way with their new remotes.",3.0,348,0.023365800865800864,0,10,1,0.08831709956709954,-0.01854745233831334,-1
"For experienced Harmony Users, its OK, but just barely. If you are a new user I sure it is the beez kneez compared to what ever you used before. If you are looking for a replacement for your Harmony One+, though, LOOK ELSEWHERE. Logitech has completely destroyed the ONE THING that made them far and away the best remotes on the market. We are talking serious competitive advantage here folks.What the heck am I rambling about, you ask Its this: the ACTIVITY BASED PARADIGM. The Ultimate still has activities, sure, but it concept has been crippled beyond recognition. Specifically, on the Harmony One+ you could define 'favorite channels' which would appear on the screen so you didn't have to remember the channel number for every thing - FOR EACH ACTIVITY. If you had two 'Watch TV' activities, you would have two sets of favorites. Example: you might have a 'Watch Cable TV' activity and a 'Watch Free-to-Air' Activity - each with its own channel changing mechanism (Cable box or TV) and each with its own channel numbers of course.The Ultimate does not allow this, there is one set of 50 favorites that you can associate with one 'Watch TV' activity. If you are in some other activity and accidently press one of your favorites, it will terminate your current activity and switch to that 'Watch TV' activity. This is NOT the behaviour we have come to expect from our Harmony remote where the programming hides the complexity and the buttons, all the buttons whether software or hardware, apply properly in the context of the activity we are using.The disastrous effect of this designed functionality transforms the Harmony range from head and shoulders above all the rest of the 'Universal Remote' into an expensive, beautiful, well made but 'Ultimately' flawed run of the mill remote.",3.0,304,0.13992704826038158,0,19,1,0.030036475869809176,-0.04617569106264907,-1
"This remote is a massive step down for the Harmony line. I've owned 5 Harmony remotes across the range and this is the worst by a long stretch. I received this remote as a courtesy replacement for my old Harmony One remote whose battery failed and leaked which I credit Logitech support for. But, that doesn't change that fact that I'd kill to have my old One back instead of this. Tech manufactures need to learn that adding a touch screen just because you can and because you can call it premium is a terrible business strategy.List of problems:1. Ergonomics - Bad button placement. The playback controls are bizarrely placed at the top of the remote, which in this DVR age, is a awful place for some very highly used buttons. The power button is very close and nearly indistinguishable from the rewind button which means about every other day I accidentally turn my system off, very frustrating. No hard page up/down buttons means you need to use the clunky gesture system.2. Touch Screen - This a low quality, unresponsive touch screen. These are common on devices where touchscreens are superfluous like thermostats and printers, but since it's a integral part of how you're expected to use this device it's a big problem. Swiping and tapping are touchy and laggy. Gestures are hit or miss. I understand why they wanted to add this since it allows them to combine the number pad, favorites list, activities, device controls and custom buttons into a single control but it makes using all these items, especially the number pad, a poor experience.3. Battery life - My 650 lasts 6-9 months on a set of batteries. My 880 would last for 2+ months on a single charge. My One would last for 4-5 weeks on a single charge. This new Ultimate One only lasts 5-7 DAYS on a single charge. It's really dismal and my device count and usage has actually decreased in the last couple years making this extra surprising, all in all a bad trend.4. Setup Software - This has always been a problem with these remotes and it's not better with this version. The software works and you only need to live with it rarely, so it's not damning, but this really should be much better. It needs a re-write from the ground up with a focus on usability and efficiency.I'm thinking that I may be abandoning the Harmony line in the not to distant future. It's a shame.",2.0,417,-0.0780713314463314,0,7,1,0.06096433427683429,-0.026525748174163866,-1
"I'm a longtime Harmony user but this is the second touchscreen remote I've used (I previously had the Harmony Touch, which is very similar). Lots of people complain about the placement of the transport buttons above the touchscreen...and I definitely feel their pain, it's a much poorer layout than the Harmony One (that prince of remotes, all hail!). If you're a TiVo user, it's a real pain in the keyster, but I think I've worked out some customizations that make it pretty usable.First, I reprogrammed the Direction Right and Direction Right buttons on the center wheel to correspond to TiVo Advance and TiVo Replay, respectively. I left the Long Press function on the buttons alone, so I can long press right or left to use the Guide. It's a compromise, but I really need the Replay and Advance features under my thumb where they belong, so this works well for me.Next, I reprogrammed the Exit button to Zoom on short press. This is a much more convenient way to expand to full screen if you're looking at the DVR guide or list. The long press will invoke TiVo Clear by default, allowing you to delete shows in your list.If you're a TiVo Bolt user (which I am), I reprogrammed the Yellow button on the right to do a sequence of Play and Select (this toggles Quick Play on and off). Quick Play is great for watching sports and longer shows at 30 faster speed with adjusted audio. It can sound a bit like Alvin and the Chipmunks, but it works well (especially for football where audio really isn't important anyway).Also for Bolt users, I reprogrammed the Green button on the far right to correspond to the D button on the new remote...this invokes Commercial Skip. As not all shows support Commercial Skip, I set up a sequence of four Advance (30-sec skip) presses for the long press on the green button...that way I can get kinda-sorta commercial skip functionality even when it's not there (also works for non-Bolt users).Using these mods, I almost never use the transport buttons on the top, which results in far less dropped remotes, inadvertent touchscreen presses, and cursing/thrown remotes.

"I have this remote. Have had it for 2 years. it is complete trash. Logitec can't design their way out of a paper bag.industrial design: every single thing about the physical device is poorly designed. the rounded bottom requires you to pick it up to press buttons. Just try reaching over with one finger and hitting volume down. the touch screen is at the same time: too sensitive, and non responsive, biased completely on getting it wrong every single time. the device has literally no seams with which to let you know, without looking at it, that you are engaging the touch screen.the battery lasts for a single day. a single day where most of the time... it isn't doing anything.the main battery drain... the touch screen, wakes up when trucks drive by, but not when you pick it up and wave it around.the Turn everything off button... is situated very closely, and shaped very similarly to the rewind button. More than once, this has caused in me a great desire to throw the remote through a window.the software:routinely, the device drops connections with bluetooth devices... necessitating a long and arduous process of resetting the connection... which as often as not: fails. It's wonderful to be unable to pause your movie, because the remote forgot how to talk to the PS3. there is a favorites list, which since the very first day, has refused to allow me to update it. A firmware update, very early into owning the remote, bricked it. leading to an oddessy of the worst customer experience I have ever had from any company anywhere (Logitec.)

You have to guess that this has occurred.pause, works approximately 1/4th of the time.sometimes just to kick your day into a higher level of frustration, the remote crashes.it NEVER turns off the PS3. even though it has been set to do so, and Logitec says that it does.and the 1 reason to avoid Logitech remotes: the latency is abominable.

"I have been a Logitech Harmony user for nearly a decade now and this is the first time I've ever been unhappy with a remote. My most recent remote had a bulging battery and wasn't holding much of a charge anymore so Logitech sent me an Ultimate One as a replacement even though it was far out of warranty. (I couldn't just replace the battery since it was bulging and stuck in the remote.) The Ultimate One remote itself works just fine once it is configured, but there are plenty of things that I still don't like about the remote.I have problems getting the MyHarmony software to work at all most of the time and I'm not really sure what I've done to get it to work the few times it has worked. It usually just sits there on the splash screen on the computer and doesn't do anything. Once I got the remote configured it works but the button layout is atrocious. Once in the software, I feel like this newer software isn't as easy to configure as the older version that I used in the past.The way the remote sits naturally in your hand, the most accessible part of the remote is the touch screen which is also the most useless part of the remote since you have to look at it to do anything. I like having the screen there when I need it, but nearly everything I use the remote for can be done via the physical buttons. The only well positioned buttons are the directional pad, ok, volume, channel, and menu. The exit button is ok too but I'd rather have something more useful in that spot like previous channel. The fast forward, play/pause, and rewind buttons are what I probably use the most with my DVR recordings and you have to hold the remote in a weird way bridging the gap over the LCD screen while making sure to not hit the LCD screen at all. The info and previous channel buttons near the very bottom are the worst positioned buttons though since they are near the very bottom of the remote and you have to be careful not to drop the remote when going for either of those buttons.I don't really miss the number pad that much like I thought I would but Logitech should have made it feel more natural to hold the remote at the very bottom by putting the battery bump right at the very bottom. They also needed to leave the LCD panel at the very top of the remote with just the power button above it and the other more used buttons all below the screen. I am going to continue using the remote since I don't want to spend the money on replacing it but you can bet on the fact that next time I need to replace my remote I will be looking at other brands if Logitech hasn't vastly improved the button layout on their remotes by that time.",2.0,504,0.061887994634473545,0,20,1,0.13094399731723672,-0.07637826882474741,-1
"For reference, my set-up consists of an LG Smart TV, a DirecTV HR-200 receiver, a Sony soundbar/subwoofer, a Chromecast, Xbox 360, PS3 and a Wii U. I wanted to consolidate the various remotes into one and make it stone-simple for the kids (and me) to press a single button and have all the inputs and devices align themselves for use properly. TL/DR summary: this remote (and hub for the PS3/Wii U) does this easily, and I would recommend highly.Wanted to write a review to help anyone out there, that like me, wasn't too sure if this was going to be a good purchase or not. There are some significantly negative reviews, and some are probably genuine, based on user's actual experiences. However, there also seems to be more than a few that are based solely on a misunderstanding or misuse of the product. If I can help clear any of that up and provide another perspective, I hope I can do so.First of all, Logitech's legacy product naming conventions compared to the current Harmony line up (as of early 2016 on their website) can get confusing. The names One, Ultimate, Home and Touch can become frustrating when trying to figure out what is best for your remote control needs. Case in point: I purchased this Ultimate One IR remote, knowing full well that I'd eventually need to add a hub to provide Bluetooth control for our Wii U and PS3. I ended up ordering the hub separately, only to find later that I could have ordered this Logitech 915-000237 Harmony Ultimate Home Touch Screen Remote for 15 Home Entertainment and Automation Devices (Black) and saved some money. Again, note that according to Logitech's current website, that package is no longer offered, but if you like this remote and think you'll need or use the hub, I'd recommend this package, as best I can tell, it is the same remote but with the addition of the hub for less then the price of the two were you to buy them individually, like I did. Oh well.Second, the Harmony compatibility site is pretty excellent. Just tell it the manufacturer and model number of your equipment and it will tell you pretty much everything you need to know. What can be controlled, what can't and which Harmony products you'll need. Comprehensive database of compatible devices, to say the least.Third, much has been said of the MyHarmony desktop software. Overall, I thought it was fine. Relatively easy to use, but you can tell it's a work in progress, as it's not quite as slick and polished as the interface on the remote itself. However, while you may end up going in a couple of circles, the software does always seem to realize what changes you've made and will ultimately guide you where you need to be. It seems smart enough to realize that some users may do things in a different order based on their specific hardware, and it catches up so to speak to ensure your remote and hub if you have one, are kept in sync. I don't think you need to be an expert to use it, but I could see where some on the lower end of the techno-savvy scale might not understand or have difficulty. My overall feeling though, is that if you're considering this line of products in the first place, you'll be fine with the software.Sidebar for a bit on the Harmony Home Hub. Logitech 915-000238 Harmony Home Hub for Smartphone Control of 8 Home Entertainment and Automation Devices The Ultimate One remote is infrared only. So, if you have any devices that require control via Bluetooth like my PS3 or Wii U, you'll need this Hub if you want to control them with the remote. (You can apparently also use the smartphone app once you have the Hub, but I haven't tried that, and don't really have any intention either. Still, nice to know it's there.) You add the Hub to your profile in the MyHarmony desktop software, and there are a couple of ways to do this, either by upgrading your remote with a hub, or by setting it up as a new Harmony device, but both methods will get you there. Again, the software will realize that installing the Hub as a new device, or upgrading the remote is the same thing, and will route you through the required steps regardless of how you do it. If you buy both, set up the remote first, then add the Hub. Once set up, the remote will have for example your activity named Play PS3 and will signal the Hub to provide the Bluetooth signal to power on the PS3. Works great.Fourth, ergonomics and usability. Lot of talk about the ergos and usability of this remote. Have to say, I honestly find the negative reviews quite surprising. In use, this is one of the best pieces of consumer tech I've ever purchased. Works exactly as promised and way, way more of a pleasure to use than a number of the reviews here make it out to be. A big part of this is the operation and behavior of the screen. It's not like your smartphone's screen prone to accidental brushes and taps. It takes an appropriately deliberate touch to activate anything, and each intentional press is confirmed by a nice little haptic feedback buzz (vibration) to let you know you what you wanted was selected.Also, and why this is rarely mentioned is beyond me, but the screen defaults to a lock screen. Meaning it lights up, but won't register a touch or press until you swipe to unlock it. In use, let's say you're watching TV and the remote is just sitting there asleep. You get up to do something or want to pause or even record to your DVR using the hardware buttons. You can absolutely use those keys without inadvertently touching something on the screen, and the screen will remain locked out. There is apparently a setting where you can turn the lock screen feature off, but I'm not sure why you would want to, as it completely removes the issue of interference by your hand. And again, it's not like an errant brush of the hand will cause an unwanted key selection anyway.On top of that, the screen features a slick gestures screen that slides up from the bottom and allows you to pause, play, volume up and down, fast forward and rewind simply by sweeping your finger or tapping the screen without ever having to look down. Again, this too works exceptionally well. The gestures screen will persist too, meaning if you slide it up to activate it, then set the remote down and it goes back to sleep. as soon as you pick it up again, the gestures screen is still there. I find myself leaving that screen open most of the time, as it's truly simple and intuitive to use.A lot has been made of how un-ergonomic this remote is, and I just don't get that, at all. In use it works extremely well, and I really do not think Logitech committed any massive deign errors. Rather it seems very well thought out and super clever.The Activities, as you set them up via the desktop application just plain work. It is fun to watch everything turn on and set themselves to the correct inputs. And even if for some reason they won't, the remote will guide you through how to fix them, which, when I read about that, I didn't really understand, until I saw it in action myself. First time I went to use my Play PS3 activity, the PS3 did not power up. The remote asked if everything came on, I told it no, it asked what device didn't, I selected PS3, and it popped up a little tutorial on how to pair the Harmony Hub with the PS3. Took maybe two minutes to pair the two and then worked perfectly. Very helpful and simple.Navigating the screens is easy, and there are only a handful of them. Dedicated home, favorites, and settings keys around the screen get you back to where you want to be immediately. Spend ten minutes using it and I promise you'll have it down pat. For every Activity or mode if you will, the controls on screen and the physical buttons assume the roles of the equipment you are currently using. For example, my Watch TV activity means I'm controlling my DirecTV receiver and the volume through my Sony amp. Therefore, the actions available on the screen and the physical buttons assume those roles. (By the way, I find the hardware keys absolutely perfect for controlling the DirecTV receiver.) Likewise, I can choose my Watch SmartTV activity, and it will bring up the apps on my TV and let me select whatever app I want with the physical keys, while the touchscreen displays my SmartTV control selections. Same with PS3, Wii, Xbox, etc. As you cycle through your modes, the remote seamlessly offers you the appropriate control options. Pretty cool indeed.Fifth, I'm not sure why battery life is such a concern. It comes with a charging cradle, seems like a no-brainer to me that when you're not using the remote, just pop it in the cradle, no Assuming most of us have to work and kids- if you have them- are in school, there has to be at least some portion of your day where you can let the remote charge up, right When you're sleeping maybe Just doesn't seem like this should be much of a concern. Longer term, I hope the non-removable battery lasts a good long while, but I'm not too worried about it.Finally, I've been more than pleasantly surprised by how well this works. Granted, I'm a smart remote neophyte, and as with any review take this review with a grain or two of salt, but I really and truly found this to be an exceptional product plus a fun grown up toy to boot. Unless you have equipment that really cannot be controlled by the Harmony products, I can't think of any major reason why I wouldn't recommend this. It's not inexpensive per se, especially if you need the Hub as well, but for as well as it works and the capability it offers, I think it's a good value.",5.0,1731,0.12816897363075713,0,57,1,0.4359155131846214,-0.18211323083096453,-1

"I purchased this remote several months ago because I received an email from Logitech offering a $100 trade in on your old remote when you purchase this remote. I starting having problems very soon after setting it up. At first it worked fine but then it wouldn't turn my TV on or off, even if I hit the help button. Worked with customer service and it started working again, briefly. It's been problematic ever since. There's frequently a delay when entering a command. There are several buttons that are dual purpose and really annoying as you have to press and hold the button to get what you want. The power off button is extremely close to the rewind/replay button(and the buttons are small) and several times I have turned off my system instead of rewinding. My remote has frozen on me many times. On one occasion I started fast forwarding through a commercial break and when I went to hit play none of the buttons would do anything. I had to grab my iPhone and pull up the app to control my system till the remote decided it was ready to function again. Of course in the mean time my DVR has gone 20 mins past where I wanted to resume watching. The battery indicator is horrible. It has 4 levels: Full, 2/3, 1/3(or as I call it-almost dead) and dead. I've had it show 2/3 full at bed time and when I wake up the next morning it's almost dead.So, what have we learned from my experience?

"I was one of those people who said that I would never pay for a universal remote, especially one over $50. I mean, how lazy must you be not to be able to use the remotes that came with your devices -- right? That was until I was hunting for my missing Roku remote and, in the process, discovered that I had 13 remotes in my 2-bedroom apartment. Between the streaming device remotes, the TVs, the gaming stations, the blu-ray player and soundbar, my coffee tables and night stand were cluttered with remotes. That's the time that I started thinking -- just thinking -- about a universal remote. When I saw that Logitech's One remote was for sale (for 50% off) I decided to jump on the opportunity. I was intimidated at first, but Logitech's software was SO EASY to use. I simply entered the model numbers of my devices and Logitech worked through the rest of the programming and automatically worked out the combo functions like turning on the TV and soundbar, changing the TV input and turning on the gaming console when I want to play Xbox. It works flawlessly! Now I carry around one remote to control all the audio/video components in my apartment.",5.0,207,0.0709733893557423,1,16,1,0.46451330532212887,-0.007232409343775337,-1
"I bought this remote to replace an BluLink PS3 remote that I had used for years with my home entertainment system. The major components are a 1080p Samsung HDTV, Yamaha Receiver and speakers, Comcast Xfinity X1 DVR Box and PS3 for streaming Netflix, MLB, and playing Blu Rays. The BluLink was designed specifically for the PS3 and pre-programmed. It could control up to 5 other devices. It had worked fine for about 5 years (but it couldn't control the DVR) and then started to hang up on the device functions whenever you turned it on. I ordered a new BluLink and it quickly developed the same issue (not sure why). I've been using the Ultimate One for about a month now and it works pretty well. It's not extremely easy to program, but the MyHarmony software is pretty straight forward, so it's easy enough to figure out. There are a couple weak points. It takes a while to load new setup configurations when you update to add an activity, add a device or change the favorite channel settings. The first time I had to stop the process and restart it, but then it has worked the couple times I've tried since without a problem. The only other complaint is that it takes a while to run through the macros it uses to execute ""Activities"" (starting and configuring multiple devices to watch TV or Netflix, etc. and even takes a while to change to favorite pre-programmed channels. . .you can see it run through the sequence of keying the channel number in and then hitting enter). You have to keep it aimed at the devices for the duration of this process or everything won't wind up working (something won't turn on, you'll get the wrong channel, etc). It is ""one-button"" control, but it's far from instantaneous. Also, If you plan to use it with a PS3 (or I assume PS4, XBOX, etc), it isn't directly compatible. You need to buy an additional adapter switch from Logitech that talks to the console. The PS3 adapter was no longer available buy the time I bought this remote, but I was able to find a refurbished one on Amazon for about $60. Other than that it works as advertised and is a reasonable solution for anyone looking to control 5-15 devices with a good amount of flexibility, as long as you are tech-savvy enough to navigate the setup.",4.0,404,0.07752866502866504,0,20,1,0.2612356674856675,-0.047187657552646645,-1

"Bought this unit at the same time as our new Samsung 8500 TV. We were interested in only having one remote for our TV, DIRECTV box, Samsung soundbar & PlayStation. I was out of town, so we had Geek Squad set everything up, then show my wife (whom was home), how it all works. Geek Squad set it up, and was explaining how everything works. He told her that this unit will not work with our PlayStation3, and we would have to buy another ""box"" to make it work. This is where the rub comes in. Best Buy salesmen knew, or should have known, that the popular PlayStation3 would not work with this ""Universal"" remote. Second, and this is far worse, the Best Buy salesman also knew that the Samsung 8500 that we were buying at the same time COMES with a universal remote! Never even mentioned that!!!Third, Geek Squad setup the remote, but didn't even bother to explain, nor even leave any information about how to further program the remote, for issues like ""favorite channels"", adding or deleting any equipment, etc.I find these things very disappointing!Back to the unit itself;Ergonomically it's terrible! Worst I've ever held. It is totally unbalanced. Kind of like holding a pear that's been cut in half lengthwise.

"The Logitech Harmony Ultimate One remote started out as a great product with easy on line programming. Controls all my devices, even older model equipment such as a CD changer. There are several serious drawbacks. First, the remote is rechargeable and that's great if you have an outlet to plug into at your favorite chair, otherwise, the battery dies without warning. It at least should have a low battery alert that gets your attention. There are times it seems to loose functionality while it still looks active, apparently when losing the charge. Doesn't turn on all the devices, (and won't repeat a command, see below). Secondly, it is awkward to impossible to use with one hand. The touchscreen must be reached across for some controls and can be touched inadvertently. The remote has an odd shape and is not comfortable. Third, if you use the remote to turn something on, it will not repeat the same command without first choosing another command. If for any reason the device changes conditions, such as the input source, from the condition the remote left it in, you must turn it all off, or choose another command before you can reuse the first. You may think it is ""locked up"". Even though the touchscreen can be inadvertently touched causing an unwanted command, choosing by touching is not that easy, especially numbers. It has a vibration feedback that takes some getting used to but you better learn to use it or you will have many missed touch commands. Lastly, it does not play well with a ""DirectvReady"" TV when operated using that feature. Using Logitech instructions, you can get some functionality, but plan on a slow process of training individual buttons to individual commands. Considering the awkwardness of the remote, it soon became not worth the trouble. Logitech's technical support was useless in helping understand or resolve the problems. If you are technically savvy, you can probably do it yourself, but the original remote will be nearby in my experience. Even when trained, the time it takes for the TV to show a picture when choosing to ""Watch TV"" with the ""DirectvReady"" as the input, is painfully slow while the TV searches for a Genie etc.Also, the complexity of a smart tv with all the menu options makes using the remote more trouble than it is worth. So, it's great for having replaced several remotes and simplifying commands such as turning on and controlling a CD changer and surround sound system. But the functionality and usability for a smart TV and ""DirectvReady"" (operates as a Direct TV ""mini"") is a drawback. There simply are not enough named button choices for it to be intuitive to use easily. I can only recommend it for the ability to turn on the right devices for a particular function, such as listen to the radio or watch a DVD. It's too expensive when you can't do it all with ease.",2.0,491,0.05665217866710404,0,10,1,0.12832608933355205,-0.05448841705043417,-1
"This is our 3rd Remote. We're really hard on our stuff, I'm not faulting the remote. How many times can you drop one until it starts acting ""buggy""?
